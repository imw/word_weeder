AB  - AIMS: This study examined the longitudinal association between reductions in 
      cannabis use and changes in anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and quality of 
      life. METHODS: Secondary analyses were conducted based on data from a cannabis 
      use disorder medication trial in 302 adults (ages 18-50). Changes in symptoms of 
      anxiety and depression, sleep quality, and quality of life were assessed in 
      relation to changes in cannabis use during the 12-week trial of treatment. 
      RESULTS: Based on the slope of individual cannabis use trajectory, the sample was 
      classified into two groups (Cannabis Use Reduction, n=152 vs. Cannabis Use 
      Increase, n=150) which was included as a binary covariate in subsequent modeling. 
      Controlling for demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), treatment condition, 
      and time-varying tobacco and alcohol use, separate latent growth curve models 
      showed a significant association between the Cannabis Use Reduction group and 
      improvement (i.e., lower values in slope) in anxiety (β=-0.09, SE=0.04; p<0.05), 
      depression (β=-0.11, SE=0.04; p<0.01), and sleep quality (β=-0.07, SE=0.03; 
      p<0.05) over the observation period, but not in quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results indicate a longitudinal relationship between reductions in cannabis 
      use and improvements in anxiety, depression, and sleep quality. Clinicians 
      treating patients with co-occurring cannabis use and problems with anxiety, 
      depression, or sleep quality should attend to cannabis use reduction as a 
      component of treatment.

AB  - Background A substantial and unmet clinical need exists for pharmacological 
      treatment of cannabis use disorders. Cannabidiol could offer a novel treatment, 
      but it is unclear which doses might be efficacious or safe. Therefore, we aimed 
      to identify efficacious doses and eliminate inefficacious doses in a phase 2a 
      trial using an adaptive Bayesian design. METHODS: We did a phase 2a, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, adaptive Bayesian trial at the 
      Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit (University College London, London, UK). We used 
      an adaptive Bayesian dose-finding design to identify efficacious or inefficacious 
      doses at a-priori interim and final analysis stages. Participants meeting 
      cannabis use disorder criteria from DSM-5 were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) in the 
      first stage of the trial to 4-week treatment with three different doses of oral 
      cannabidiol (200 mg, 400 mg, or 800 mg) or with matched placebo during a 
      cessation attempt by use of a double-blinded block randomisation sequence. All 
      participants received a brief psychological intervention of motivational 
      interviewing. For the second stage of the trial, new participants were randomly 
      assigned to placebo or doses deemed efficacious in the interim analysis. The 
      primary objective was to identify the most efficacious dose of cannabidiol for 
      reducing cannabis use. The primary endpoints were lower urinary 
      11-nor-9-carboxy-δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH):creatinine ratio, increased 
      days per week with abstinence from cannabis during treatment, or both, evidenced 
      by posterior probabilities that cannabidiol is better than placebo exceeding 0·9. 
      All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered 
      with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02044809) and the EU Clinical Trials Register 
      (2013-000361-36). FINDINGS: Between May 28, 2014, and Aug 12, 2015 (first stage), 
      48 participants were randomly assigned to placebo (n=12) and to cannabidiol 200 
      mg (n=12), 400 mg (n=12), and 800 mg (n=12). At interim analysis, cannabidiol 200 
      mg was eliminated from the trial as an inefficacious dose. Between May 24, 2016, 
      and Jan 12, 2017 (second stage), randomisation continued and an additional 34 
      participants were allocated (1:1:1) to cannabidiol 400 mg (n=12), cannabidiol 800 
      mg (n=11), and placebo (n=11). At final analysis, cannabidiol 400 mg and 800 mg 
      exceeded primary endpoint criteria (0·9) for both primary outcomes. For urinary 
      THC-COOH:creatinine ratio, the probability of being the most efficacious dose 
      compared with placebo given the observed data was 0·9995 for cannabidiol 400 mg 
      and 0·9965 for cannabidiol 800 mg. For days with abstinence from cannabis, the 
      probability of being the most efficacious dose compared with placebo given the 
      observed data was 0·9966 for cannabidiol 400 mg and 0·9247 for cannabidiol 800 
      mg. Compared with placebo, cannabidiol 400 mg decreased THC-COOH:creatinine ratio 
      by -94·21 ng/mL (95% interval estimate -161·83 to -35·56) and increased 
      abstinence from cannabis by 0·48 days per week (0·15 to 0·82). Compared with 
      placebo, cannabidiol 800 mg decreased THC-COOH:creatinine ratio by -72·02 ng/mL 
      (-135·47 to -19·52) and increased abstinence from cannabis by 0·27 days per week 
      (-0·09 to 0·64). Cannabidiol was well tolerated, with no severe adverse events 
      recorded, and 77 (94%) of 82 participants completed treatment. INTERPRETATION: In 
      the first randomised clinical trial of cannabidiol for cannabis use disorder, 
      cannabidiol 400 mg and 800 mg were safe and more efficacious than placebo at 
      reducing cannabis use. FUNDING: Medical Research Council.

      Disability, and Psychological aspects. A Prospective Non randomized Single Arm 
      Clinical Trial.
PG  - e102-e107
LID - 10.7417/T.2018.2062 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an increasing interest in the medical use of cannabis, 
      particularly in the treatment of chronic pain. OBJECTIVES: The aim is to evaluate 
      the effects of cannabis use and the associated benefits reported by patients with 
      various chronic pain diagnoses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 338 patients 
      with different chro- nic pain conditions were treated with a Cannabis Flos 19% 
      decoction for 12 months, in addition to their pharmacological therapy. Baseline 
      levels for pain medications, pain intensity, pain disability, anxiety and 
      depression were recorded at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Pain intensity 
      records a statistically significant reduction from Baseline to 12 months follow 
      up (X² 61.375; P<0,001); the im- provements from Baseline to 12 months follow up 
      are also recorded in pain disability (X² 39.423; P<0,001) and in anxiety and 
      depression symptoms (X²30.362; P<0,001; X²27.786; P<0,001). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study suggest that Cannabis therapy, as an adjun- ct a traditional analgesic 
      therapy, can be an efficacious tool to make more effective the management of 
      chronic pain and its consequences on functional and psychological dimension. 
      Further randomized, controlled trials are needed to confirm our conclusions.

TI  - Depressive symptoms and cannabis use in a placebo-controlled trial of 
      N-Acetylcysteine for adult cannabis use disorder.
PG  - 479-490
LID - 10.1007/s00213-019-05384-z [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Depression is common among individuals with cannabis use disorder 
      (CUD), particularly individuals who present to CUD treatment. Treatments that 
      consider this comorbidity are essential. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this secondary 
      analysis was to examine whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced depressive 
      symptoms among adults (age 18-50) with CUD (N = 302) and whether the effect of 
      NAC on cannabis cessation varied as a result of baseline levels of depression. 
      Bidirectional associations between cannabis use amount and depression were also 
      examined. METHODS: Data for this secondary analysis were from a National Drug 
      Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (NIDA CTN) multi-site clinical trial for 
      CUD. Adults with CUD (N = 302) were randomized to receive 2400 mg of NAC daily or 
      matched placebo for 12 weeks. All participants received abstinence-based 
      contingency management. Cannabis quantity was measured by self-report, and weekly 
      urinary cannabinoid levels (11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol) confirmed 
      abstinence. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms did not differ between the NAC and 
      placebo groups during treatment. There was no significant interaction between 
      treatment and baseline depression predicting cannabis abstinence during 
      treatment. Higher baseline depression was associated with decreased abstinence 
      throughout treatment and a significant gender interaction suggested that this may 
      be particularly true for females. Cross-lagged panel models suggested that 
      depressive symptoms preceded increased cannabis use amounts (in grams) during the 
      subsequent month. The reverse pathway was not significant (i.e., greater cannabis 
      use preceding depressive symptoms). CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest 
      that depression may be a risk factor for poor CUD treatment outcome and therefore 
      should be addressed in the context of treatment. However, results do not support 
      the use of NAC to concurrently treat co-occurring depressive symptoms and CUD in 
      adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01675661.

AB  - BACKROUND: Pharmacotherapy for cannabis use disorder (CUD) is an important unmet 
      public health need. METHODS: In a 12-week randomized double-blind 
      placebo-controlled trial, the efficacy of quetiapine (300 mg nightly) for the 
      treatment of CUD was tested in 130 outpatients. Weekly cannabis use was 
      categorized into three groups: heavy use (5-7 days), moderate use (2-4 days) and 
      light use (0-1 days). RESULTS: At baseline both groups were considered heavy 
      users (using days per week: median = 7.0; interquartile range (IQR): 6.5-7.0; 
      daily dollar value: median = $121.4; IQR: 73.8-206.3). The week-by-treatment 
      interaction was marginally significant (χ(2)(2) = 5.56, P = .06). With each week, 
      the odds of moderate compared to heavy use significantly increased in the 
      quetiapine group (OR=1.17, P < .0001), but not significantly in the placebo group 
      (OR=1.05, P = .16). The odds of light versus heavy use did not significantly 
      differ over time (P = .12). Treatment was also associated with reduced cannabis 
      withdrawal symptoms by 10.4% each week (95% CI: 8.9-11.8). No serious adverse 
      events occurred during the study and no evidence of development of a movement 
      disorder was detected. Adverse effects were not significantly different between 
      the quetiapine and placebo treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: The use of quetiapine to 
      treat CUD was associated with an increased likelihood of heavy frequency use 
      transitioning to moderate use, but not light use. The clinical significance of 
      reductions in cannabis use, short of abstinence warrants further study.

PG  - e170-e174
LID - 10.1097/ADM.0000000000000652 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cannabis and tobacco dual use is a growing concern in the United 
      States, especially among African Americans (AAs). Dual use increases nicotine 
      dependence and poses negative health effects. Despite decreasing numbers of 
      people who smoke daily, nondaily smokers (NDS) are increasing. Polytobacco use, 
      including blunt use, is higher in AA NDS than AAs who smoke daily. This study 
      examined factors associated with cannabis use among AA NDS. METHODS: Adult AA NDS 
      participated in a randomized controlled trial (n = 278) for smoking cessation. A 
      subset of this sample (n = 262; mean age 48.2 years; 50% male) was analyzed to 
      identify correlates of cannabis use. Logistic regression assessed the 
      associations of demographic, smoking-related, and psychosocial variables with 
      cannabis use. RESULTS: Participants smoked cigarettes on an average of 18 days of 
      the last 30 and used 4.5 cigarettes on smoking days. Of the participants 
      analyzed, 38% used cannabis, including blunts (ie, cigars hollowed out filled 
      with cannabis) at baseline. Cannabis use was associated with polytobacco product 
      use not including blunts (odds ratio [OR] 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      1.18-3.77, P = 0.012), depressive symptoms (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.42, 
      P = 0.011), and younger age (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-0.99, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Rates of cannabis and tobacco dual use in our sample exceed national rates. Dual 
      use poses harmful health effects that exceed the risk of either substance alone. 
      Findings will inform future work in tailoring treatments to vulnerable groups of 
      people who use both tobacco and cannabis.

TI  - Day-level shifts in social contexts during youth cannabis use treatment.
PG  - 251-263
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000647 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social context plays a critical role in youth cannabis use. Yet few 
      studies have examined if and when social contexts shift during cannabis use 
      treatment. This study examined daily shifts in youths' social contexts with the 
      goal of characterizing how specific social contexts (e.g., time with 
      cannabis-using friends or siblings) relate to cannabis craving and use during 
      cannabis treatment. METHOD: Participants were 65 cannabis users (51% male), ages 
      15-24 years, who participated in a double-blind randomized clinical trial that 
      tested the effects of motivational enhancement and cognitive behavioral therapies 
      plus either adjunctive pharmacotherapy or placebo on cannabis craving and use. 
      Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data, collected from a pre-randomization 
      period through the completion of the six-week intervention, assessed youths' 
      social contexts, cannabis use, and craving. RESULTS: Time-varying effects models 
      identified shifts in social contexts during treatment. Overall, time spent with 
      cannabis-using friends and siblings decreased, where time spent with non-using 
      friends or alone increased across the trial. Time with parents or non-using 
      siblings was unchanged. Comparing the relative associations of social contexts 
      with same-day craving and use, more time with cannabis-using friends and with 
      siblings was uniquely associated with greater craving and use. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Social context is an important factor in youth substance-use treatment. While 
      time spent with cannabis-using friends and siblings decreased over treatment for 
      all participants, those who continued to spend time with using individuals 
      reported greater craving and use. This research supports increased attention to 
      shifting youths' social contexts to enhance treatment success. (PsycInfo Database

AB  - BACKGROUND: An efficacious pharmacotherapy for cannabis use disorder (CUD) has 
      yet to be established. This study preliminarily evaluated the safety and efficacy 
      of varenicline for CUD in a proof-of-concept clinical trial. METHODS: 
      Participants in this 6-week randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial received 
      either varenicline (n = 35) or placebo (n = 37), added to a brief motivational 
      enhancement therapy intervention. Outcomes included cannabis withdrawal, cannabis 
      abstinence, urine cannabinoid levels, percent cannabis use days, and cannabis 
      sessions per day. RESULTS: Both treatment groups noted significant decreases in 
      self-reported cannabis withdrawal, percentage of days used, and use sessions per 
      day during treatment compared to baseline. While this pilot trial was not powered 
      to detect statistically significant between-group differences, participants 
      randomized to varenicline evidenced numerically greater rates of self-reported 
      abstinence at the final study visit [Week 6 intent-to-treat (ITT): Varenicline: 
      17.1% vs. Placebo: 5.4%; RR = 3.2 (95% CI: 0.7,14.7)]. End-of-treatment urine 
      creatinine corrected cannabinoid levels were numerically lower in the varenicline 
      group and higher in the placebo group compared to baseline [Change from baseline: 
      Varenicline -1.7 ng/mg (95% CI: -4.1,0.8) vs. Placebo: 1.9 ng/mg (95% CI: 
      -0.4,4.3); Δ = 3.5 (95% CI: 0.1,6.9)]. Adverse events related to study treatment 
      did not reveal new safety signals. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the feasibility 
      of conducting clinical trials of varenicline as a candidate pharmacotherapy for 
      CUD, and indicate that a full-scale efficacy trial, powered based on effect sizes 
      and variability yielded in this study, is warranted.

TI  - Effects of cannabis use on alcohol consumption in a sample of treatment-engaged 
      heavy drinkers in Colorado.
PG  - 2529-2537

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cannabis is commonly used among people who drink alcohol, 
      but evidence suggests a nuanced relationship between alcohol consumption and 
      cannabis use. In particular, among individuals undergoing alcohol treatment the 
      impact of cannabis on alcohol intake may depend upon cannabis use frequency. We 
      aimed to test the effects of within-day cannabis use on total drinks consumed and 
      likelihood of binge drinking on a given day among all participants and compare 
      these relationships between males and females and between individuals who 
      reported infrequent and frequent cannabis use. DESIGN: This observational study 
      is a substudy of a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT). Individuals were 
      included from the RCT if they reported any cannabis use and were divided into 
      groups based on cannabis use patterns. Alcohol use was compared within and 
      between groups. SETTING: Individuals were recruited from 2016 to 2020 from 
      community and university settings in Denver and Boulder, CO, USA. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Of the 182 individuals enrolled in the RCT, 96 cannabis-using subjects were 
      included in these analyses. MEASUREMENTS: Subjects completed a time-line 
      follow-back (TLFB) at baseline, 4, 8 (end of treatment) and 20 weeks. Daily data 
      on alcohol and cannabis use from the TLFB at all time-points were analyzed. 
      FINDINGS: Across the sample (n = 96), individuals drank approximately 29% fewer 
      drinks [95% confidence interval (CI) = 18-39%, P < 0.001] and were 2.06 times 
      (95% CI =1.37-3.08, P < 0.001) less likely to have a binge-drinking episode on 
      days that cannabis was used compared with days that cannabis was not used. These 
      patterns were observed in males, females and the infrequent and frequent cannabis 
      use groups. Findings were inconclusive regarding differences in the association 
      between cannabis use and alcohol outcomes when comparing males and females and 
      when comparing infrequent and frequent cannabis use groups. CONCLUSIONS: Heavy 
      drinkers engaged in treatment to reduce their alcohol consumption who also use 
      cannabis appear to increase their cannabis use on days when they reduce their 
      alcohol consumption.

AB  - Background: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective in adult 
      substance-use treatment and may be helpful for adolescents and young adults 
      (AYAs). One target of MBIs is to improve trait mindfulness, which has been 
      associated with better lifestyle and health outcomes. To inform MBIs for reducing 
      cannabis use in AYAs, we sought to identify how trait mindfulness was associated 
      with cannabis-related problems and quit attempts, as well as with motivation to 
      change use in youth who report frequent use. Methods: Participants aged 15-24 
      years using cannabis ≥ 3x/week were recruited from AYA clinics in a northeastern 
      US city to participate in a cannabis-use intervention pilot, randomized trial. At 
      baseline, we assessed cannabis-use history, problems associated with use, 
      attempts to quit, and trait mindfulness. All participants were offered two 
      sessions of motivational enhancement therapy, during which they rated motivation 
      to quit cannabis. Regression analyses were conducted to assess associations 
      between trait mindfulness and cannabis use-related problems, attempts to quit, 
      and motivation to change. Results: Seventy participants, mean age 20.7 ± 1.9 
      years, enrolled. Sixty percent identified as female, 47% as Black non-Hispanic, 
      and 31% as Hispanic. Participants started using cannabis at mean age 15.0 ± 2.8 
      years and were using ≥ 3x/week by 17.0 ± 2.3 years. Higher mindfulness scores 
      were associated with fewer cannabis-related problems (p = 0.004) and fewer quit 
      attempts (p = 0.035). The number of cannabis-related problems did not 
      significantly mediate the relationship between mindfulness and quit attempts. 
      Trait mindfulness did not predict motivation to change cannabis use. Conclusions: 
      Among AYAs using cannabis frequently, higher trait mindfulness was associated 
      with both fewer cannabis use--related problems and fewer quit attempts. Future 
      research should assess whether trait mindfulness is an appropriate target for 
      decreasing cannabis use and the utility of MBIs for reducing cannabis-use 
      behaviors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Combustible tobacco smoking and cannabis use frequently occur 
      together, and the use of both substances is associated with overall greater 
      severity of tobacco and cannabis related problems. Observational work has found 
      that cannabis use is associated with tobacco cessation failure, but research 
      directly testing the longitudinal associations of cannabis use on tobacco 
      cessation during smoking cessation treatment is lacking. The current study 
      examined the impact of current cannabis use on combustible tobacco cessation 
      outcomes. METHODS: 207 daily combustible tobacco smokers (M(age) = 38.24 years, 
      SD = 14.84, 48.1 % male) were enrolled in a randomized controlled smoking 
      cessation trial. Survival analyses and multi-level modeling were used to assess 
      lapse and relapse behavior through 12-week follow up. The current study is a 
      secondary data analysis. RESULTS: Results of the current study suggest that 
      cannabis use is associated with faster time to lapse (OR = 0.644, se = .188, p =  
      .019), but not relapse (OR = -0.218, se = .403, p =  .525), compared to 
      combustible tobacco-only smokers. Additionally, cannabis use was associated with 
      lower likelihood of achieving any 7-day point prevalence abstinence during the 12 
      week follow up (b = 0.93, se = 0 0.24, p =  0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The current 
      study provides novel evidence that cannabis use may be related to combustible 
      tobacco use in terms of faster time to lapse and lower likelihood of any 7-day 
      point prevalence abstinence following smoking cessation treatment. Developing 
      integrated cannabis-tobacco cessation treatments is an important next step in 
      research focused on tobacco-cannabis use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior research shows that cannabis use during treatment for Alcohol 
      Use Disorders (AUD) is related to fewer abstinent days from alcohol, although 
      only among those who use cannabis 1-2x/month. Here we extend prior research by 
      assessing the relationship between the frequency of cannabis use during AUD 
      treatment and post-treatment alcohol-related consequences. METHODS: Data come 
      from the Combined Pharmacotherapies and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE) Study, 
      a large US randomized control trial of treatments for AUD. The current analyses 
      include 206 cannabis users and 999 cannabis abstainers and compare longitudinal 
      drinking data between those who used cannabis versus those who abstained during 
      COMBINE treatment. The primary exposure was quartiles of cannabis use (Q1: less 
      than 1x/month during treatment, Q2: 1-2x/month, Q3: 4-8x/month, Q4: 12x/month or 
      more), with cannabis abstainers as the reference group. Outcomes were 
      alcohol-related problems at the end of treatment and one-year post-treatment as 
      measured by the Drinker Inventory Consequences. RESULTS: Compared to cannabis 
      abstinence, the most frequent use during treatment was related to 1.44 times as 
      many physical consequences one-year post-treatment. Cannabis use was not related 
      to physical consequences immediately after treatment, or to intrapersonal, 
      interpersonal, social responsibility or impulse control problems at either 
      post-treatment time point. CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of individuals in treatment 
      for AUD, using cannabis 12x/month or more during treatment is associated with 
      increased rates of physical consequences attributed to alcohol use. Individuals 
      in treatment for AUD who also use cannabis might benefit from reducing or 
      stopping cannabis use to avoid alcohol-related physical problems.

TI  - Latency to cannabis dependence mediates the relationship between age at cannabis 
      use initiation and cannabis use outcomes during treatment in men but not women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Time from first cannabis use to cannabis dependence (latency) may be 
      an important prognostic indicator of cannabis-related problems and treatment 
      outcomes. Gender differences in latency have been found; however, research in 
      this general area is limited. As cannabis use increases and perceived risk 
      declines, a better understanding of how these factors interact in predicting 
      treatment outcomes is critical. METHODS: A secondary data analysis of a 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy trial for cannabis 
      dependence (N = 302) examined the associations between age of cannabis use onset, 
      time to cannabis dependence (latency), and gender on cannabis use during the 
      trial. Mediation analysis tested whether the association between age of onset and 
      cannabis use during the trial was mediated by latency to cannabis dependence 
      differentially for men and women. RESULTS: Age of use initiation was inversely 
      correlated with latency to dependence prior to treatment [HR(95% CI) = 1.18 
      (1.06, 1.30); p = .002] and cannabis use during treatment (β=-1.27; SE = 0.37; p 
      < .001). There was a significant mediation effect between age of onset, latency, 
      and cannabis use that varied by gender. Earlier age of onset predicted longer 
      latency, and subsequently, greater cannabis use during the trial in men (21.4% 
      mediated; p < .05), but not women. Other substance use, race, and past 
      psychiatric diagnosis did not predict latency either independently or in 
      interaction models. CONCLUSION: Findings support existing evidence that early 
      cannabis use onset is associated with worse outcomes and add new knowledge on the 
      differential associations between age of onset, latency to cannabis dependence, 
      and treatment outcomes for men and women.

AB  - Adults with ADHD describe self-medicating with cannabis, with some reporting a 
      preference for cannabis over ADHD medications. A small number of psychiatrists in 
      the US prescribe cannabis medication for ADHD, despite there being no evidence 
      from randomised controlled studies. The EMA-C trial (Experimental Medicine in 
      ADHD-Cannabinoids) was a pilot randomised placebo-controlled experimental study 
      of a cannabinoid medication, Sativex Oromucosal Spray, in 30 adults with ADHD. 
      The primary outcome was cognitive performance and activity level using the 
      QbTest. Secondary outcomes included ADHD and emotional lability (EL) symptoms. 
      From 17.07.14 to 18.06.15, 30 participants were randomly assigned to the active 
      (n=15) or placebo (n=15) group. For the primary outcome, no significant 
      difference was found in the ITT analysis although the overall pattern of scores 
      was such that the active group usually had scores that were better than the 
      placebo group (Est=-0.17, 95%CI-0.40 to 0.07, p=0.16, n=15/11 active/placebo). 
      For secondary outcomes Sativex was associated with a nominally significant 
      improvement in hyperactivity/impulsivity (p=0.03) and a cognitive measure of 
      inhibition (p=0.05), and a trend towards improvement for inattention (p=0.10) and 
      EL (p=0.11). Per-protocol effects were higher. Results did not meet significance 
      following adjustment for multiple testing. One serious (muscular seizures/spasms) 
      and three mild adverse events occurred in the active group and one serious 
      (cardiovascular problems) adverse event in the placebo group. Adults with ADHD 
      may represent a subgroup of individuals who experience a reduction of symptoms 
      and no cognitive impairments following cannabinoid use. While not definitive, 
      this study provides preliminary evidence supporting the self-medication theory of 
      cannabis use in ADHD and the need for further studies of the endocannabinoid 
      system in ADHD.

TI  - Biomarkers of Recent Cannabis Use in Blood, Oral Fluid and Breath.
PG  - 820-828
LID - 10.1093/jat/bkab080 [doi]
AB  - Proving driving under the influence of cannabis (DUIC) is difficult. Establishing 
      a biomarker of recent use to supplement behavioral observations may be a useful 
      alternative strategy. We determined whether cannabinoid concentrations in blood, 
      oral fluid (OF) or breath could identify use within the past 3 h-likely the 
      period of the greatest impairment. In a randomized trial, 191 frequent (≥4/week) 
      and occasional (<4/week) cannabis users smoked one cannabis (placebo [0.02%], or 
      5.9% or 13.4% Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) cigarette ad libitum. Blood, OF and 
      breath samples were collected prior to and up to 6 h after smoking. Samples were 
      analyzed for 10 cannabinoids in OF, 8 in blood and THC in breath. Frequent users 
      had more residual THC in blood and were more likely to be categorized as 
      'recently used' prior to smoking; this did not occur in OF. Per se limits ranging 
      from undetectable to 5 ng/mL THC in blood offered limited usefulness as 
      biomarkers of recent use. Cannabinol (CBN, cutoff = 1 ng/mL) in blood offered 
      100% specificity but only 31.4% sensitivity, resulting in 100% positive 
      predictive value (PPV) and 94.0% negative predictive value (NPV) at 4.3% 
      prevalence; however, CBN may vary by cannabis chemovar. A 10 ng/mL THC cutoff in 
      OF exhibited the overall highest performance to detect its use within 3 h (99.7% 
      specificity, 82.4% sensitivity, 92.5% PPV and 99.2% NPV) but was still detectable 
      in 23.2% of participants ∼4.4 h post-smoking, limiting specificity at later time 
      points. OF THC may be a helpful indicator of recent cannabis intake, but this 
      does not equate to impairment. Behavioral assessment of impairment is still 
      required to determine DUIC. This study only involved cannabis inhalation, and 
      additional research evaluating alternative routes of ingestion (i.e., oral) is 
      needed.

TI  - Acute effects of cannabinoids on symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder: A 
      human laboratory study.
PG  - 801-811
LID - 10.1002/da.23032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preclinical data implicate the endocannabinoid system in the 
      pathology underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), while survey data have 
      linked OCD symptoms to increased cannabis use. Cannabis products are increasingly 
      marketed as treatments for anxiety and other OCD-related symptoms. Yet, few 
      studies have tested the acute effects of cannabis on psychiatric symptoms in 
      humans. METHODS: We recruited 14 adults with OCD and prior experience using 
      cannabis to enter a randomized, placebo-controlled, human laboratory study to 
      compare the effects on OCD symptoms of cannabis containing varying concentrations 
      of Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) on OCD symptoms to 
      placebo. We used a within-subjects design to increase statistical power. Across 
      three laboratory sessions, participants smoked three cannabis varietals in random 
      order: placebo (0% THC/0% CBD); THC (7.0% THC/0.18% CBD); and CBD (0.4% THC/10.4% 
      CBD). We analyzed acute changes in OCD symptoms, state anxiety, cardiovascular 
      measures, and drug-related effects (e.g., euphoria) as a function of varietal. 
      RESULTS: Twelve participants completed the study. THC increased heart rate, blood 
      pressure, and intoxication compared with CBD and placebo. Self-reported OCD 
      symptoms and anxiety decreased over time in all three conditions. Although OCD 
      symptoms did not vary as a function of cannabis varietal, state anxiety was 
      significantly lower immediately after placebo administration relative to both THC 
      and CBD. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first placebo-controlled investigation of 
      cannabis in adults with OCD. The data suggest that smoked cannabis, whether 
      containing primarily THC or CBD, has little acute impact on OCD symptoms and 
      yields smaller reductions in anxiety compared to placebo.

TI  - Ketamine-facilitated behavioral treatment for cannabis use disorder: A proof of 
      concept study.
PG  - 92-97
LID - 10.1080/00952990.2020.1808982 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions may benefit a range of psychiatric 
      conditions, including alcohol and cocaine use disorders. Currently, there are no 
      effective pharmacological treatments for cannabis use disorder. OBJECTIVES: The 
      objective of this uncontrolled proof of concept trial was to test the 
      feasibility, tolerability, and potential therapeutic effects of integrating 
      ketamine infusions with a behavioral platform of motivational enhancement therapy 
      and mindfulness-based relapse prevention in treating cannabis use disorder (CUD). 
      METHODS: Eight cannabis-dependent individuals (four female, four male) receiving 
      motivational enhancement therapy and mindfulness-based relapse prevention 
      behavioral treatments completed this single-blind outpatient 6-week study. 
      Participants received either one or two infusions of ketamine (0.71 mg/kg 
      [infusion 1]; 1.41 mg/kg [infusion 2] for non-responders) during the study. 
      Participants self-reported cannabis use (Timeline Follow-Back) and underwent an 
      assessment of confidence in abstaining from using cannabis (Drug-Taking 
      Confidence Questionnaire) at predetermined time points throughout the study. 
      RESULTS: Ketamine infusions were well-tolerated and there were no adverse events. 
      Frequency of cannabis use decreased significantly from baseline (B = 5.1, 
      s.e = 0.7) to the week following the first infusion (B = 0.8, s.e = 0.412), and 
      remained reduced at the end of the study (B = 0.5, s.e = 0.3). Participants' 
      confidence in their ability to abstain from cannabis in potentially triggering 
      situations increased significantly from baseline to the end of study. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that combining ketamine with behavioral 
      therapy is feasible,tolerable, and potentially helpful, in treating 
      cannabis-dependent individuals.

TI  - Cannabis and Alcohol Co-Use in a Smoking Cessation Pharmacotherapy Trial for 
      Adolescents and Emerging Adults.
PG  - 1374-1382
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntz170 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The co-use of cannabis and alcohol among tobacco-using youth is 
      common. Alcohol co-use is associated with worse tobacco cessation outcomes, but 
      results are mixed regarding the impact of cannabis on tobacco outcomes and if 
      co-use leads to increased use of non-treated substances. This secondary analysis 
      from a youth smoking cessation trial aimed to (1) evaluate the impact of cannabis 
      or alcohol co-use on smoking cessation, (2) examine changes in co-use during the 
      trial, and (3) explore secondary effects of varenicline on co-use. METHODS: The 
      parent study was a 12-week, randomized clinical trial of varenicline for smoking 
      cessation among youth (ages 14-21, N = 157; Mage = 19, 40% female; 76% White). 
      Daily cigarette, cannabis, and alcohol use data were collected via daily diaries 
      during treatment and Timeline Follow-back for 14 weeks post-treatment. RESULTS: 
      Baseline cannabis co-users (68%) had double the odds of continued cigarette 
      smoking throughout the trial compared with noncannabis users, which was 
      pronounced in males and frequent cannabis users. Continued smoking during 
      treatment was associated with higher probability of concurrent cannabis use. 
      Baseline alcohol co-users (80%) did not have worse smoking outcomes compared with 
      nonalcohol users, but continued smoking was associated with higher probability of 
      concurrent drinking. Varenicline did not affect co-use. CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistent 
      with prior literature, results showed that alcohol co-users did not differ in 
      smoking cessation, whereas cannabis co-users had poorer cessation outcomes. Youth 
      tobacco treatment would benefit from added focus on substance co-use, 
      particularly cannabis, but may need to be tailored appropriately to promote 
      cessation. IMPLICATIONS: Among youth cigarette smokers enrolled in a 
      pharmacotherapy evaluation clinical trial, alcohol and/or cannabis co-use was 
      prevalent. The co-use of cannabis affected smoking cessation outcomes, but more 
      so for males and frequent cannabis users, whereas alcohol co-use did not affect 
      smoking cessation. Reductions in smoking were accompanied by concurrent 
      reductions in alcohol or cannabis use. Substance co-use does not appear to affect 
      all youth smokers in the same manner and treatment strategies may need to be 
      tailored appropriately for those with lower odds of smoking cessation.

TI  - Moderated Mediation of the eCHECKUP TO GO College Student Cannabis Use 
      Intervention.
PG  - 1508-1515
LID - 10.1080/10826084.2021.1937225 [doi]
AB  - Background: Cannabis use rates are rising among college students, creating a need 
      for effective and accessible intervention options. One such intervention, the 
      Marijuana eCHECKUP TO GO (eCTG) program, has relatively few studies investigating 
      mechanisms of change and related outcomes. This intervention provides users with 
      personalized normative feedback to adjust user's normative perceptions and use 
      patterns. The current study tested moderated mediation of program effects between 
      the eCTG intervention condition and a healthy stress management (HSM) control 
      condition in a college student sample of near-daily cannabis users. Protective 
      behavioral strategies (PBS) were measured among the eCTG conditionMethods: Data 
      were analyzed from a sample of 227 students who were randomly assigned to the 
      eCTG intervention condition or HSM control condition. Change in cannabis use 
      frequency was measured by re-administering the baseline survey at a six-week 
      follow-up. Multi-group moderated mediation path analysis tested the effects of 
      the eCTG intervention on change in cannabis use frequency through PBS, 
      descriptive norms, and injunctive norms, with multi-group categories defined by 
      sex.Results: Direct effects indicated the intervention predicted reduced 
      descriptive norm perceptions and cannabis use frequency. An indirect effect was 
      found for the intervention condition on reducing cannabis use frequency through 
      change in descriptive norms in males. Similarly, an indirect effect was seen for 
      intervention condition on reducing cannabis use frequency through change in 
      injunctive norms for females.Conclusions: Findings suggest changes in descriptive 
      norms played a sex-specific mediating role in the mechanisms of change for the 
      eCTG intervention on reductions in cannabis use frequency.

TI  - Effect of Cannabidiol and Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol on Driving Performance: A 
      Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 2177-2186
LID - 10.1001/jama.2020.21218 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Cannabis use has been associated with increased crash risk, but the 
      effect of cannabidiol (CBD) on driving is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine the 
      driving impairment caused by vaporized cannabis containing 
      Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 
      double-blind, within-participants, randomized clinical trial was conducted at the 
      Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University in the 
      Netherlands between May 20, 2019, and March 27, 2020. Participants (N = 26) were 
      healthy occasional users of cannabis. INTERVENTIONS: Participants vaporized 
      THC-dominant, CBD-dominant, THC/CBD-equivalent, and placebo cannabis. THC and CBD 
      doses were 13.75 mg. Order of conditions was randomized and balanced. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was standard deviation of lateral 
      position (SDLP; a measure of lane weaving) during 100 km, on-road driving tests 
      that commenced at 40 minutes and 240 minutes after cannabis consumption. At a 
      calibrated blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.02%, SDLP was increased 
      relative to placebo by 1.12 cm, and at a calibrated BAC of 0.05%, SDLP was 
      increased relative to placebo by 2.4 cm. RESULTS: Among 26 randomized 
      participants (mean [SD] age, 23.2 [2.6] years; 16 women), 22 (85%) completed all 
      8 driving tests. At 40 to 100 minutes following consumption, the SDLP was 18.21 
      cm with CBD-dominant cannabis, 20.59 cm with THC-dominant cannabis, 21.09 cm with 
      THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis, and 18.28 cm with placebo cannabis. SDLP was 
      significantly increased by THC-dominant cannabis (+2.33 cm [95% CI, 0.80 to 
      3.86]; P < .001) and THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis (+2.83 cm [95% CI, 1.28 to 
      4.39]; P < .001) but not CBD-dominant cannabis (-0.05 cm [95% CI, -1.49 to 1.39]; 
      P > .99), relative to placebo. At 240 to 300 minutes following consumption, the 
      SDLP was 19.03 cm with CBD-dominant cannabis, 19.88 cm with THC-dominant 
      cannabis, 20.59 cm with THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis, and 19.37 cm with placebo 
      cannabis. The SDLP did not differ significantly in the CBD (-0.34 cm [95% CI, 
      -1.77 to 1.10]; P > .99), THC (0.51 cm [95% CI, -1.01 to 2.02]; P > .99) or 
      THC/CBD (1.22 cm [95% CI, -0.29 to 2.72]; P = .20) conditions, relative to 
      placebo. Out of 188 test drives, 16 (8.5%) were terminated due to safety 
      concerns. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a crossover clinical trial that assessed 
      driving performance during on-road driving tests, the SDLP following vaporized 
      THC-dominant and THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis compared with placebo was 
      significantly greater at 40 to 100 minutes but not 240 to 300 minutes after 
      vaporization; there were no significant differences between CBD-dominant cannabis 
      and placebo. However, the effect size for CBD-dominant cannabis may not have 
      excluded clinically important impairment, and the doses tested may not represent 
      common usage. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EU Clinical Trials Register: 2018-003945-40.

AB  - AIM: This study aimed to analyze the association between any past-month cannabis 
      use and advanced liver fibrosis. BACKGROUND: Cannabinoid receptors play a role in 
      acute and chronic liver injury, but human studies addressing the impact of 
      cannabis use on liver fibrosis have shown mixed results. OBJECTIVE: The objective 
      of this study was to explore and estimate the association between pastmonth 
      cannabis use and advanced liver fibrosis (ALF) in a cohort of Russian 
      HIV-positive individuals with heavy alcohol use and a high prevalence of 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. METHODS: Baseline data were analyzed from 
      participants of the ZINC study, a trial that enrolled HIV-positive Russian 
      patients without prior antiretroviral therapy. Cannabis use during the prior 
      month was assessed at study entry. ALF was defined as FIB-4>3.25 and APRI>1.5. 
      Transient elastography was used to detect advanced liver fibrosis among 
      participants with FIB-4 values in the intermediate range (between 1.45 and 3.25). 
      RESULTS: Participants (n=248) were mostly male (72.6%), young (median age of 33.9 
      years), infected with HCV (87.9%), and did not have advanced immunosuppression 
      (median CD4 count 465). Cannabis use was uncommon (12.4%), and the prevalence of 
      advanced liver disease was 21.7%. The prevalence of ALF was similar among those 
      who used cannabis compared to those who did not (25.8% vs. 21.7%). We were unable 
      to detect an association between cannabis use and ALF (adjusted odds ratio: 1.28, 
      95% confidence interval: 0.53-3.12, p=0.59) in logistic regression models 
      adjusting for age, sex, heavy drinking, BMI, and CD4 cell count. CONCLUSION: In 
      this exploratory study among HIV-positive heavy drinking Russians, we did not 
      detect an association between recent cannabis use and ALF. Larger scale studies, 
      including more participants with cannabis use, are needed to examine this 
      relationship further.

AB  - The main active ingredient in cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can 
      acutely induce psychotic symptoms and impair episodic and working memory. Another 
      major constituent, cannabidiol (CBD), may attenuate these effects. This study 
      aimed to determine the effects of THC and CBD, both alone and in combination on 
      psychotic symptoms and memory function. A randomised, double-blind crossover 
      design compared the effects of (i) placebo, (ii) THC 8 mg, (iii) CBD 16 mg and 
      (iv) THC 8 mg + CBD 16 mg administered by inhalation through a vaporiser. Using 
      an experimental medicine approach to predict treatment sensitivity, we selected 
      48 cannabis users from the community on the basis of (1) schizotypal personality 
      questionnaire scores (low, high) and (2) frequency of cannabis use (light, 
      heavy). The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Psychotomimetic States 
      Inventory (PSI), immediate and delayed prose recall (episodic memory), 1- and 
      2-back (working memory) were assessed on each day. Results indicated that THC 
      increased overall scores on the PSI, negative symptoms on BPRS, and robustly 
      impaired episodic and working memory. Co-administration of CBD did not attenuate 
      these effects. CBD alone reduced PSI scores in light users only. At a ratio of 
      2:1, CBD does not attenuate the acute psychotic and memory impairing effects of 
      vaporised THC. Frequent cannabis users may show a blunted anti- psychotic 
      response to CBD, which is of concern due to the high rates of cannabis use 
      disorders in patients with schizophrenia.

LID - 10.1111/ajad.12959 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: No medication has Food and Drug Administration 
      approval for cannabis use disorder (CUD), and most medication development focuses 
      on the withdrawal syndrome. We evaluated the effects of short-term treatment 
      using the α-2A-adrenergic receptor agonist, guanfacine, on withdrawal symptoms in 
      volunteers with CUD and a history of early onset of cannabis use. METHODS: 
      Non-treatment-seeking healthy volunteers (n = 7) who met the Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition criteria for CUD participated 
      in a two-phase, within-subjects study. Volunteers received placebo or guanfacine 
      (3 mg/day) for the first 8-day inpatient study and the alternative medication for 
      the second 8-day inpatient study. On day 1 of both treatment periods, 
      participants received 30 mg of synthetic Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol for 
      standardization of abstinence onset. On days 2 to 7, participants received study 
      medication. Cannabis withdrawal symptoms, sleep, craving, and physiology were 
      assessed on all inpatient days. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, guanfacine did 
      not show significant effects on withdrawal, craving, or sleep, although there 
      were trends for guanfacine to increase positive mood symptoms and decrease 
      craving-associated compulsivity. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Compared with former 
      studies, we could not prove significant improvement in sleep or decrease of 
      negative symptoms, but we found trends for increased positive mood symptoms. Our 
      data did not show significant effects of guanfacine on withdrawal symptoms or 
      craving. Due to early and longer cannabis use, our subjects indicate a great 
      severity of illness increasing the likelihood of treatment resistance. SCIENTIFIC 
      SIGNIFICANCE: On the basis of trends demonstrated here and other lines of 
      evidence, further investigation is warranted regarding the utility of guanfacine 
      as a potential treatment for CUD. (Am J Addict 2019;00:1-10).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of blunt smoking among cannabis users, 
      very few studies examine the clinical profile of blunt smokers relative to those 
      using more common methods of cannabis use, such as joints. METHODS: The current 
      study uses baseline data from the ACCENT (Achieving Cannabis Cessation-Evaluating 
      N-acetylcysteine Treatment) study, a multi-site randomized pharmacotherapy 
      clinical trial within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network, 
      to predict the association between blunt and joint use frequency and cannabis use 
      characteristics (e.g., grams of cannabis used) and consequences (e.g., 
      withdrawal) among past-month cannabis users (N = 377) who were screened for study 
      participation. RESULTS: After controlling for race, age, gender, other forms of 
      cannabis use (including joint use) and nicotine dependence, multivariable linear 
      regression models indicated that the number of days of blunt use in the past 
      month was a significant predictor of the average amount of cannabis per using day 
      (t = 3.04, p <  .01), the estimated average cost of cannabis (t = 2.28, p <  .05) 
      and Cannabis Withdrawal Scale scores (t = 1.94, p <  .05). Frequency of joint use 
      did not significantly predict any of the cannabis use characteristics or 
      consequences. CONCLUSIONS: Blunt smokers may present to treatment with greater 
      amounts of cannabis smoked and more intense withdrawal symptoms, which may 
      adversely impact their likelihood of successful abstinence. Cannabis-dependent 
      blunt smokers may be more likely to benefit from treatment that targets 
      physiological and mood-related withdrawal symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Poly-use of tobacco, cannabis, and electronic cigarettes 
      (e-cigarettes) is an emerging problem in the general population. The current 
      study investigated poly-use of these products and receipt of smoking cessation 
      counseling in a primary care setting. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional 
      secondary data analysis from a trial of a tablet intervention to increase 
      provider delivery of the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange follow-up), a 
      brief counseling intervention for smoking cessation, in 3 diverse primary care 
      clinics in San Francisco, CA from 2014 to 2015. Participants were currently 
      smoking cigarettes (N = 601; mean age = 50.8; 38.1% female) and reported 
      information on past 30-day cigarette and e-cigarette use and past 3-month 
      cannabis use. We classified participants into 4 groups: (1) cigarette-only, (2) 
      dual-use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes, (3) dual-use of cigarettes and cannabis, 
      (4) poly-use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and cannabis, and examined correlates 
      of use. RESULTS: Only cigarette smoking was reported by 48.6% of participants, 
      30.4% reported use of cigarettes and cannabis, 10.5% reported use of cigarettes 
      and e-cigarettes, and 10.5% reported use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and 
      cannabis. Cigarette-only smokers did not differ from other groups by cigarette 
      smoking behavior and motivation to quit. Patients reporting dual-use of 
      cigarettes and e-cigarettes had a higher likelihood of receiving the Arrange step 
      and all 5As compared to cigarette-only smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Providers should 
      screen for co-use of cigarettes and other nicotine/cannabis products and consider 
      co-use when delivering smoking cessation treatment and evaluating treatment 
      outcomes. Development of guidelines to help facilitate provider training is 
      needed.

TI  - An experimental investigation of peer rejection and social anxiety on alcohol and 
      cannabis use willingness: Accounting for social contexts and use cues in the 
      laboratory.
PG  - 887-894
LID - 10.1037/adb0000711 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evidence suggests that social anxiety (SA) is a risk factor for 
      problematic alcohol and cannabis use, particularly during states of social 
      stress. Unfortunately, laboratory studies to date have overlooked decision-making 
      mechanisms (e.g., use willingness) and contextual features of commonly used 
      social stress tasks that may clarify what is driving these links. The current 
      study begins to address this gap by testing the effects of SA and 
      laboratory-induced peer rejection on acute alcohol and cannabis use willingness 
      within a simulated party setting. METHOD: 80 emerging adults (18-25 years; 70% 
      women) endorsing lifetime alcohol and cannabis use were randomly assigned to 
      experience rejection or neutral social cues. They rated their willingness to use 
      alcohol and cannabis before and after cue exposure within the simulated party. A 
      hierarchical regression tested the main and interaction effects of SA symptoms 
      and experimental condition (Rejection vs. Neutral) on alcohol and cannabis use 
      willingness, controlling for past-year use frequency and willingness to accept 
      any offers (e.g., food and nonalcoholic drinks). RESULTS: There were 
      statistically significant main (but not interaction) effects of SA and 
      experimental condition on cannabis use willingness. Higher SA and Rejection 
      exposure were each associated with greater cannabis use willingness. There were 
      neither main nor interaction effects on alcohol willingness. CONCLUSIONS: Results 
      suggest that elevated SA increases cannabis use willingness across social 
      contexts, regardless of Rejection exposure, while Rejection exposure increases 
      use willingness similarly across levels of SA. Together, findings reinforce the 
      need to consider social-contextual factors and polysubstance use in laboratory 
      settings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).

AB  - BACKGROUND: More effective treatments for cannabis use disorder (CUD) are needed. 
      Evidence suggests that biases in cognitive processing of drug-related stimuli are 
      central to the development and maintenance of addiction. The current study 
      examined the feasibility and effect of a novel intervention - approach bias 
      modification (ApBM) - on cannabis approach bias and cue-reactivity. METHODS: A 
      randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled proof-of-principle laboratory 
      experiment investigated the effect of a four-session computerized ApBM training 
      protocol on cannabis approach bias and cue-reactivity in non-treatment seeking 
      adults age 18-65 with CUD (N = 33). ApBM procedures involved responding to 
      cannabis or neutral stimuli using a computer joystick to model approach or 
      avoidance behavior. Reactivity to tactile, olfactory, and auditory cue sets was 
      assessed with physiological (blood pressure and heart rate) and subjective 
      (cannabis craving) measures. Cannabis use was assessed via self-report. RESULTS: 
      Participants receiving ApBM showed blunted cannabis cue-induced craving at the 
      end of training compared to those in the sham-ApBM condition (p = .05). A 
      preliminary gender effect on cannabis use was also found; men receiving ApBM 
      reported fewer cannabis use sessions per day at the end of training compared to 
      women (p = .02), while there were no differences between men and women in the 
      sham condition. ApBM did not attenuate cannabis approach bias following training. 
      CONCLUSION: Preliminary results indicate that ApBM may be efficacious in reducing 
      cannabis cue-reactivity and improving cannabis use outcomes. While encouraging, 
      the results should be interpreted with caution. Investigation of ApBM as an 
      adjunct to psychosocial treatments for treatment-seeking adults with CUD is 
      warranted.

AB  - Research has demonstrated that motivational enhancement (MET) and cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) are some of the most effective interventions for adults 
      with cannabis use disorder (CUD). As few as two sessions of combined MET and CBT 
      has produced abstinence and reductions in cannabis use greater than delayed 
      treatment controls. Despite their efficacy, outcomes in previous studies yielded 
      abstinence rates from cannabis in the range of 20-30% at follow-ups of 6 to 
      12 months, and CUD remained a chronic condition for many. Additional models of 
      providing treatment "as needed" (PRN), rather than as a single fixed-dose, are 
      necessary to meet the different needs of adults with CUD and reengage those who 
      do not respond to treatment initially or who relapse later. In the current study, 
      87 adults who met DSM-IV criteria for cannabis dependence were randomly assigned 
      to receive either a fixed-dose of nine sessions of MET/CBT or to a PRN condition 
      that provided a smaller initial dose of treatment, but allowed repeated access to 
      treatment for 28 months. Cannabis use and associated problems were assessed every 
      six months throughout a 34-month period. More than one-third of participants in 
      the PRN condition accessed additional treatment episodes, but the total number of 
      treatment sessions that participants utilized was comparable across conditions. 
      Both treatments yielded significant reductions in cannabis use and associated 
      problems at each follow-up. Contrary to hypotheses, the PRN condition did not 
      yield better outcomes at the longer-term follow-ups. The fixed-dose condition 
      produced greater rates of abstinence at the first follow-up, but otherwise there 
      were no between group differences in outcomes. Future studies should test active 
      approaches to reengaging participants with treatment when initial outcomes are 
      less than optimal.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are a wide variety of methods for using combustible cannabis 
      which may impact an individual's pattern of use as well as their response to 
      cannabis use disorder (CUD) treatment. Previous research has noted racial/ethnic 
      differences in cannabis users' preferred method of use. METHOD: The current study 
      examined data from a randomized placebo-controlled trial of a pharmacological 
      intervention for adults with CUD. Latent profile analysis classified participants 
      (N = 302) based on their primary method of combustible cannabis use. RESULTS: A 
      four profile solution emerged which identified participants who demonstrated 1) 
      Primarily Joint (n = 50), 2) Primarily Blunt (n = 106), 3) Mixed MoU (n = 30), 
      and 4) Primarily Pipe (i.e., pipe or bong; n = 116) use. Profiles were compared 
      on socio-demographic characteristics and racial differences were found among the 
      four latent profiles as well as differences in their level of use. Cannabis users 
      with a preference for joints were more likely to be White as compared to other 
      racial groups. In contrast, a greater proportion of participants with a 
      preference for blunts were African American. The Primarily Joint profile was 
      found to have the highest cannabis relapse rate at 1-month follow-up (94%) which 
      was significantly greater than the Mixed MoU (74%, x(2) = 5.06, p < .05) and 
      Primarily Pipe (78%, x(2) = 9.24, p < .01) profiles. Interestingly, there was no 
      difference in 1-Month Follow-up cannabis relapse rates between the Primarily 
      Joint and Blunt profiles (87%, x(2) = 9.24, p > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings 
      suggest that treatment-seeking individuals who primarily use joints or blunts may 
      face unique challenges that may impact cannabis abstinence. Along with other 
      cannabis-related characteristics, an individual's preferred method of use may 
      represent an important factor to consider in the treatment of CUD.

AB  - Disparities remain in HIV viral load (VL) suppression between people living with 
      HIV (PLWH) who use cocaine and those who do not. It is not known how cannabis use 
      affects VL suppression in PLWH who use cocaine. We evaluated the relationship 
      between cannabis use and VL suppression among PLWH who use cocaine. We conducted 
      a secondary data analysis of 119 baseline interviews from a randomized controlled 
      trial in the Bronx, NY (6/2012 to 1/2017). Participants were adult PLWH 
      prescribed antiretrovirals for ≥16 weeks, who endorsed imperfect antiretroviral 
      adherence and used cocaine in the past 30-days. In bivariate and multivariable 
      regression analyses, we examined how cannabis use, is associated with VL 
      suppression among PLWH who use cocaine. Participants were a mean age of 50 years; 
      most were male (64%) and non-Hispanic black (55%). Participants with VL 
      suppression used cocaine less frequently than those with no VL suppression 
      (p < 0.01); cannabis use was not significantly different. In regression analysis, 
      compared with no use, daily/near-daily cannabis use was associated with VL 
      suppression (aOR = 4.2, 95% CI: 1.1-16.6, p < 0.05). Less-frequent cannabis use 
      was not associated with VL suppression. Further investigation is needed to 
      understand how cannabis use impacts HIV outcomes among PLWH who use cocaine.

TI  - Effects of topiramate on the association between affect, cannabis craving, and 
      cannabis use in the daily life of youth during a randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 3095-3106
LID - 10.1007/s00213-021-05925-5 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Topiramate is an anticonvulsant currently under study for treating 
      substance use disorders. Topiramate is thought to reduce substance use by 
      attenuating craving and the rewarding effects of acute substance use through its 
      concurrent GABAergic agonism and glutamatergic antagonism. Importantly, 
      topiramate also impacts mood states central to many models of substance use. 
      Despite this, little previous research has examined whether topiramate attenuates 
      the respective associations of affect and craving with substance use. OBJECTIVES: 
      We conducted a secondary analysis of 63 youths that exhibited heavy cannabis use, 
      aged 15-24 years, who were randomized in a double-blinded 6-week clinical trial 
      comparing the effects of topiramate (up to 200 mg/day) and placebo on cannabis 
      use. Ecological momentary assessment data were leveraged to model the role 
      positive affect, negative affect, and craving on use over the 6-week period and 
      whether topiramate attenuated associations between these feeling states and 
      cannabis use. RESULTS: Findings showed that craving was positively associated 
      with use at the within-person level, while positive affect was negatively 
      associated with use at the between-person level. Topiramate appears to attenuate 
      the negative association of between-person positive affect (i.e., average) and 
      cannabis use. Specifically, those in the placebo condition exhibited this inverse 
      association between average positive affect and use while those in topiramate 
      condition did not. No other significant affect or affect × medication condition 
      interactions were observed. CONCLUSIONS: These findings implicate craving and low 
      positive affect as important risk factors for cannabis use in youth in treatment. 
      Topiramate may attenuate this association for positive affect.

AB  - Tobacco smoking among those seeking treatment for cannabis use disorder (CUD) is 
      common and is a negative predictor of cannabis outcomes. Quitting tobacco may be 
      beneficial for those seeking to quit cannabis use. This initial proof of concept, 
      controlled trial was designed to compare a simultaneous versus sequential tobacco 
      intervention among those seeking treatment for CUD. Sixty-seven adults received 
      either a simultaneous (SIM) or sequential (SEQ) approach to tobacco cessation in 
      the context of outpatient treatment for CUD. A tobacco intervention (TI) that 
      combined web-based counseling with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was 
      provided during weeks 1-12 for SIM and was delayed until weeks 13-24 for SEQ. 
      During weeks 1-12, no between-condition significant differences were observed on 
      treatment participation or cannabis use outcomes. The majority of SIM 
      participants initiated TI counseling (62%), 50% made at least one quit attempt 
      and 41% initiated NRT. Interestingly, 39% in SEQ made tobacco quit attempts and 
      18% initiated NRT on their own before the TI was offered to them. However, only 
      30% of those in SEQ continued treatment during weeks 13-24, which compromised 
      between-condition comparisons following the TI, but illustrated a potential 
      clinical concern with delaying the TI. Tobacco cessation outcomes generally were 
      poor and did not differ between conditions. This initial controlled trial 
      suggests that addressing tobacco use during CUD treatment is acceptable and 
      generates action towards tobacco cessation. Additional trials testing more 
      intensive TI models may be necessary to identify more efficacious interventions 
      for co-use of cannabis and tobacco.

TI  - VOICES: An efficacious trauma-informed, gender-responsive cannabis use 
      intervention for justice and school-referred girls with lifetime substance use 
      history.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Girls have unique developmental pathways to substance use and justice 
      system involvement, warranting gender-responsive intervention. We tested the 
      efficacy of VOICES (a 12-session, weekly trauma-informed, gender-responsive 
      substance use intervention) in reducing substance use and HIV/STI risk behaviors 
      among justice- and school-referred girls. METHODS: Participants were 113 girls 
      (M(age) = 15.7 years, SD = 1.4; 12 % White, 19 % Black, 15 % multi-racial; 42 % 
      Latinx) with a history of substance use referred from juvenile justice (29 %) and 
      school systems (71 %). Study assessments were completed at baseline, 3-, 6- and 
      9-months follow-up. Primary outcomes included substance use and HIV/STI risk 
      behaviors; secondary outcomes included psychiatric symptoms (including 
      posttraumatic stress) and delinquent acts. We hypothesized that girls randomized 
      to the VOICES (n = 51) versus GirlHealth (attention control; n = 62) condition 
      would report reduced alcohol, cannabis and other substance use, HIV/STI risk 
      behaviors, psychiatric symptoms, and delinquent acts. RESULTS: Girls randomized 
      to VOICES reported significantly less cannabis use over 9-month follow-up 
      relative to the control condition (time by intervention, p < .01), but there were 
      no between group differences over time in HIV/STI risk behavior. Girls in both 
      conditions reported fewer psychiatric symptoms and delinquent acts over time. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Data support the use of a trauma-informed, gender-responsive 
      intervention to reduce cannabis use among girls with a substance use history and 
      legal involvement; reducing cannabis use in this population has implications for 
      preventing future justice involvement and improving public health outcomes for 
      girls and young women, who are at disproportionate health and legal risk relative 
      to their male counterparts.

TI  - Tobacco use during cannabis cessation: Use patterns and impact on abstinence in a 
      National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network study.
PG  - 59-66
LID - S0376-8716(18)30471-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.07.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is common for cannabis users to also use tobacco. While data 
      suggest that tobacco users have more difficulty achieving cannabis cessation, 
      secondary analyses of clinical trial data sets may provide insight into the 
      moderating variables contributing to this relationship, as well as changes in 
      tobacco use during cannabis treatment. Those were the aims of this secondary 
      analysis. METHODS: The parent study was a multi-site trial of N-acetylcysteine 
      for cannabis dependence conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment 
      Clinical Trials Network. Participants were treatment-seeking adults (ages 18-50) 
      who met criteria for cannabis dependence (N = 302). For cigarette smokers 
      (n = 117), tobacco use was assessed via timeline follow-back and nicotine 
      dependence was assessed via the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). 
      Outcome measures included: 1) changes in tobacco use based on treatment 
      assignment, nicotine dependence, and concurrent cannabis reduction/abstinence, 
      and 2) independent associations between nicotine dependence and cannabis 
      abstinence. RESULTS: Cigarette smokers accounted for 39% of the sample (117/302), 
      with a median FTND score of 3.0 (10-point scale). Among those with lower baseline 
      nicotine dependence scores, cigarette smoking was reduced in the active treatment 
      group compared to placebo. Those with moderate/high levels of nicotine dependence 
      showed slight increases in smoking following active treatment. Nicotine 
      dependence did not affect cannabis cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking 
      during cannabis treatment was affected, but depended on baseline nicotine 
      dependence severity, though dependence levels did not impact cannabis abstinence. 
      Interventions that address both tobacco and cannabis are needed, especially due 
      to an increasing prevalence of cannabis use.

TI  - Guanfacine extended-release for cannabis use disorder: a pilot feasibility trial.
PG  - 44-48
LID - 10.1080/00952990.2019.1620259 [doi]
AB  - Background: Currently, there are no established pharmacotherapies for cannabis 
      use disorders (CUDs). As a long-acting alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist, 
      guanfacine extended-release (G-XR) could be useful in the treatment of CUDs by 
      mitigating withdrawal and improving behavioral control.Objectives: To evaluate 
      the feasibility and tolerability of G-XR as a treatment for CUDs.Methods: In an 
      eight-week open-label outpatient pilot trial, we evaluated the safety and 
      tolerability of G-XR in 22 cannabis dependent individuals. Using 2 different 
      titration schedules, G-XR was gradually titrated to a dose of 4 mg or the highest 
      dose tolerated. All participants received standard medication management.Results: 
      Retention at week eight was 41%. Average daily amount of cannabis use (in grams: 
      F(1,86) = 8.74, p = .004; in dollars: F(1,86) = 16.67, p < .0001) and cannabis 
      using days (F(1,86) = 7.67, p = .007) significantly reduced over the course of 
      study participation. There were no significant differences between the titration 
      schedules on emergence of side effects (Fisher exact test, p = .378) or retention 
      (Log-Rank Test X(2)(1) = 0.021, p = .886). A total of 3 participants achieved 
      3 weeks or greater of total abstinence.Conclusions: G-XR is a feasible treatment 
      for CUDs, and should be evaluated further in an efficacy trial.

TI  - Cannabis Use is Associated with Lower Odds of Prescription Opioid Analgesic Use 
      Among HIV-Infected Individuals with Chronic Pain.
PG  - 1602-1607

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is common in the United States and prescribed opioid 
      analgesics use for noncancer pain has increased dramatically in the past two 
      decades, possibly accounting for the current opioid addiction epidemic. Co-morbid 
      drug use in those prescribed opioid analgesics is common, but there are few data 
      on polysubstance use patterns. OBJECTIVE: We explored patterns of use of 
      cigarette, alcohol, and illicit drugs in HIV-infected people with chronic pain 
      who were prescribed opioid analgesics. METHODS: We conducted a secondary data 
      analysis of screening interviews conducted as part of a parent randomized trial 
      of financial incentives to improve HIV outcomes among drug users. In a 
      convenience sample of people with HIV and chronic pain, we collected self-report 
      data on demographic characteristics; pain; patterns of opioid analgesic use (both 
      prescribed and illicit); cigarette, alcohol, and illicit drug use (including 
      cannabis, heroin, and cocaine) within the past 30 days; and current treatment for 
      drug use and HIV. RESULTS: Almost half of the sample of people with HIV and 
      chronic pain reported current prescribed opioid analgesic use (N = 372, 47.1%). 
      Illicit drug use was common (N = 505, 63.9%), and cannabis was the most commonly 
      used illicit substance (N = 311, 39.4%). In multivariate analyses, only cannabis 
      use was significantly associated with lower odds of prescribed opioid analgesic 
      use (adjusted odds ratio = 0.57; 95% confidence interval: 0.38-0.87). 
      Conclusions/Importance: Our data suggest that new medical cannabis legislation 
      might reduce the need for opioid analgesics for pain management, which could help 
      to address adverse events associated with opioid analgesic use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance and complexity of addressing both substance use and 
      mood disorders such as depression within traditional treatment settings is well 
      established. However, little is known about this issue within the context of 
      mHealth treatment. Research is needed to determine if depression interacts with 
      mHealth delivered cannabis use disorder treatment similarly compared traditional 
      treatments. OBJECTIVE: We examined the moderating effect of depressive symptoms 
      on cannabis use with 96 young adults (ages 18 to 25) enrolled in a text-delivered 
      randomized clinical trial for cannabis use disorder. Participants were followed 
      for three months. METHOD: We used a repeated measures general linear model to 
      test if depressive symptoms moderated the treatment's effect on cannabis use. 
      Self-report of past 30-day use and urinalysis of THC metabolites were the outcome 
      measures. Depressive symptoms were measured using the PHQ-2, with scores >3 
      serving as the clinical cut-point, indicating likely depression disorder. 
      RESULTS: Participants with sub-threshold depression scores significantly reduced 
      the number of days they used cannabis across all three months of the study. For 
      participants with scores above the clinical cut-point, treatment had no effect on 
      cannabis use. Similarly, participants with sub-threshold depression scores 
      reduced the number of positive urinalysis results at three months. Effect sizes 
      ranged from small to medium. CONCLUSION: Results support the importance of 
      simultaneously addressing depressive symptoms and cannabis use when treating 
      young adults using text-delivered counseling. As mHealth interventions continue 
      to demonstrate efficacy in addressing substance use disorders, the integration of 
      mood disorder treatments appears warranted.

AB  - AIMS: Cannabis use disorder (CUD) and depression frequently co-occur in youth. 
      How depressive symptoms change over the course of CUD treatment and how they 
      impact substance use treatment outcomes is unknown. In the current study, we 
      examine the temporal relationships between cannabis use and depression in 
      adolescents receiving evidence-based treatments for CUD as part of a multisite 
      clinical trial. DESIGN: Six hundred adolescents (age 12-18) with a CUD were 
      randomly assigned to substance use treatment from one of five evidence-based 
      psychosocial interventions. We assessed self-reported cannabis use frequency and 
      depressive symptoms at baseline (BL) and again at 3-, 6-, 9, and 12-months. A 
      bivariate latent change model assessed bidirectional effects of baseline levels 
      and time-lagged changes in depressive symptoms and cannabis use on depression and 
      cannabis use outcomes. FINDINGS: Depressive symptoms (72%) and major depressive 
      disorder (MDD) (18%) were common at BL. Both depression and cannabis use 
      decreased over time and change in cannabis use was significantly associated with 
      change in depressive symptoms (b = 1.22, p = .003). Time-lag analyses showed that 
      within-subject change in depression (from one time point to the next) was 
      predicted by previous depression (b = -0.71, p < .001) but not cannabis use 
      (p = .068), and change (decrease) in cannabis use was predicted by previous 
      (greater) depressive symptoms (b = -1.47, p < .001) but not cannabis use 
      (p = .158), respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate an enduring 
      relationship between decreasing cannabis use and decreasing depression among 
      adolescents lasting for 9-months after receiving psychosocial interventions for 
      CUD. The presence of depressive symptoms did not appear to interfere with 
      substance use treatment or attenuate improvements in cannabis use frequency. A 
      decrease in cannabis use was not contingent upon a reduction in depressive 
      symptoms. These findings are limited by the possibility of regression to the mean 
      for both cannabis use and depressive symptoms, and the lack of a nonintervention 
      control group.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Previous studies suggest cannabinoid agonist treatment is 
      effective in reducing cannabis use in dependent treatment seekers, however few 
      studies have reported on post-treatment outcomes. We examine cannabis use 
      outcomes 12 weeks after cessation of treatment from a randomised 
      placebo-controlled trial of nabiximols for the treatment of cannabis dependence. 
      METHOD: 128 participants received either nabiximols (n = 61) or placebo (n = 67) 
      for 12 weeks, in combination with psychosocial interventions. Self-reported 
      number of days of cannabis use in the previous 28 days was measured at baseline, 
      4, 8, and 12 weeks (end of treatment) and again at 24 weeks (3 months after 
      treatment ceased). Urinalysis was used to confirm self-report data at Week 24 
      interview. RESULTS: A factorial mixed-effects model for repeated measures 
      regression revealed that the nabiximols group used cannabis on 6.8 fewer days in 
      the previous 28 days at week 12 (end of treatment) than the placebo group (p = 
      0.002, CI: 2.1,11.4), and 6.7 fewer days in the previous 28 days at the week-24 
      follow-up than the placebo group (p = 0.006, CI: 1.4,12.1). A significantly 
      higher proportion of the nabiximols group (14/61; 23 %) than the placebo group 
      (6/67; 9%) reported abstinence from cannabis in the previous 28 days at the 
      week-24 research interview OR=3.0, CI: 1.1, 9.1; p=0.035, NNT=8, CI: 4, 71). 
      DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of treatment incorporating nabiximols 
      with psychosocial interventions in reducing cannabis use appears to persist for 
      up to 3 months after the cessation of treatment. A stepped care model of 
      treatment is proposed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials

TI  - One Month of Cannabis Abstinence in Adolescents and Young Adults Is Associated 
      With Improved Memory.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Associations between adolescent cannabis use and poor neurocognitive 
      functioning have been reported from cross-sectional studies that cannot determine 
      causality. Prospective designs can assess whether extended cannabis abstinence 
      has a beneficial effect on cognition. METHODS: Eighty-eight adolescents and young 
      adults (aged 16-25 years) who used cannabis regularly were recruited from the 
      community and a local high school between July 2015 and December 2016. 
      Participants were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of cannabis abstinence, verified 
      by decreasing 11-nor-9-carboxy-∆⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol urine concentration 
      (MJ-Abst; n = 62), or a monitoring control condition with no abstinence 
      requirement (MJ-Mon; n = 26). Attention and memory were assessed at baseline and 
      weekly for 4 weeks with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. 
      RESULTS: Among MJ-Abst participants, 55 (88.7%) met a priori criteria for 
      biochemically confirmed 30-day continuous abstinence. There was an effect of 
      abstinence on verbal memory (P = .002) that was consistent across 4 weeks of 
      abstinence, with no time-by-abstinence interaction, and was driven by improved 
      verbal learning in the first week of abstinence. MJ-Abst participants had better 
      memory overall and at weeks 1, 2, 3 than MJ-Mon participants, and only MJ-Abst 
      participants improved in memory from baseline to week 1. There was no effect of 
      abstinence on attention: both groups improved similarly, consistent with a 
      practice effect. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that cannabis abstinence is 
      associated with improvements in verbal learning that appear to occur largely in 
      the first week following last use. Future studies are needed to determine whether 
      the improvement in cognition with abstinence is associated with improvement in 
      academic and other functional outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Therapist and computer-based brief interventions for drug use within a randomized 
      controlled trial: effects on parallel trajectories of alcohol use, cannabis use 
      and anxiety symptoms.
PG  - 158-169
LID - 10.1111/add.14781 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Despite their high comorbidity, the effects of brief 
      interventions (BI) to reduce cannabis use, alcohol use and anxiety symptoms have 
      received little empirical attention. The aims of this study were to examine 
      whether a therapist-delivered BI (TBI) or computer-guided BI (CBI) to address 
      drug use, alcohol consumption (when relevant) and HIV risk behaviors, relative to 
      enhanced usual care (EUC), was associated with reductions in parallel 
      trajectories of alcohol use, cannabis use and anxiety symptoms, and whether 
      demographic characteristics moderated reductions over time. DESIGN: Latent growth 
      curve modeling was used to examine joint trajectories of alcohol use, cannabis 
      use and anxiety symptoms assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months after baseline 
      enrollment. SETTING: Hurley Medical Center Emergency Department (ED) in Flint, 
      MI, USA. PARTICIPANTS: The sample was 780 drug-using adults (aged 18-60 years; 
      44% male; 52% black) randomly assigned to receive either a TBI, CBI or EUC 
      through the HealthiER You study. INTERVENTIONS AND COMPARATOR: ED-delivered TBI 
      and CBIs involved touchscreen-delivered and audio-assisted content. The TBI was 
      administered by a Master's-level therapist, whereas the CBI was self-administered 
      using a virtual health counselor. EUC included a review of health resources 
      brochures in the ED. MEASUREMENTS: Assessments of alcohol use (10-item Alcohol 
      Use Disorders Identification Test), cannabis use (past 30-day frequency) and 
      anxiety symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory-18) occurred at baseline and 3-, 6- and 
      12-month follow-up. FINDINGS: TBI, relative to EUC, was associated with 
      significant reductions in cannabis use [B = -0.49, standard error (SE) = 0.20, 
      P < 0.05) and anxiety (B = -0.04, SE = 0.02, P < 0.05), but no main effect for 
      alcohol use. Two of 18 moderation tests were significant: TBI significantly 
      reduced alcohol use among males (B = -0.60, SE = 0.19, P < 0.01) and patients 
      aged 18-25 years in the TBI condition showed significantly greater reductions in 
      cannabis use relative to older patients (B = -0.78, SE = 0.31, P < 0.05). Results 
      for CBI were non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency department-based 
      therapist-delivered brief interventions to address drug use, alcohol consumption 
      (when relevant) and HIV risk behaviors may also reduce alcohol use, cannabis use 
      and anxiety over time, accounting for the overlap of these processes.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Cannabis use is common among young adults and has been proposed 
      as a potential treatment for insomnia. However, controlled studies examining the 
      impact of cannabis use on insomnia symptoms are rare. This secondary analysis of 
      published trial data tested cannabis use during cognitive behavioral treatment 
      for insomnia (CBT-I) as a moderator of treatment efficacy. METHODS: Young adults 
      (ages 18-30 years) who reported past-month binge drinking (4/5+ drinks for 
      women/men) and met diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder were randomized to 
      CBT-I (n = 28) or sleep hygiene (n = 28) groups. Interaction effects were tested 
      using multilevel models. Outcomes included insomnia severity, actigraphy-assessed 
      sleep efficiency, diary-assessed sleep quality, drinking quantity, and 
      alcohol-related consequences. RESULTS: Twenty-six participants (46%; 12 in the 
      sleep hygiene group and 14 in the CBT-I group) reported using cannabis during the 
      treatment phase of the study, on an average of 23% of treatment days (range, 
      3%-100%). Relative to those who did not use cannabis, participants who used 
      cannabis during treatment reported heavier drinking and more frequent cigarette 
      use. Approximately 1 in 4 cannabis users (27%) reported using cannabis to help 
      with sleep; however, cannabis users and nonusers did not differ in the use of 
      alcohol as a sleep aid. Controlling for sex, race, drinking quantity, cigarette 
      use, symptoms of depression, and symptoms of anxiety, use of cannabis during 
      treatment did not moderate CBT-I effects on insomnia severity (b, -.002; p = .99) 
      or other outcomes (all p > .20). CONCLUSIONS: CBT-I is effective in reducing 
      insomnia symptoms among young adult drinkers with insomnia, regardless of 
      cannabis use. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov; Name:

TI  - Parsing impulsivity in individuals with anxiety and depression who use Cannabis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with anxiety/depression may impulsively use cannabis to 
      acutely induce positive affect and attenuate aversive mood states. However, few 
      studies have attempted to parse impulsivity displayed by anxious/depressed 
      cannabis users. This investigation examined what aspects of impulsivity 
      characterize those individuals using self-report and functional MRI (fMRI) 
      measures. METHODS: Individuals with any lifetime anxiety/depression diagnoses and 
      problematic cannabis use ("Anx/Dep+CB"; n=42) were compared to a propensity 
      score-matched group with very low cannabis use ("Anx/Dep-lowCB"; n=42), and a 
      healthy control group (n=37). Impulsivity was measured using the UPPS-P 
      Impulsivity Questionnaire and the Stop Signal Task (SST) during fMRI. For UPPS-P, 
      regression models estimated group-by-impulsivity subscale interactions with 
      post-hoc pairwise tests. For the SST, similar regression models were estimated 
      with four a-priori regions of interest (ROIs; right opercularis, orbitalis, 
      dorsal and ventral anterior insula) during stop-success and stop-failure 
      processing. Null SST findings were followed up using Bayes factor analysis to 
      quantify the evidence in support of the null hypothesis. RESULTS: For the UPPS-P, 
      a significant group-by-subscale interaction indicated that the Anx/Dep+CB group 
      exhibited higher levels of impulsivity on the negative- and positive-urgency 
      subscales relative to both comparison groups. Higher negative-urgency correlated 
      with heavier lifetime cannabis use across groups. For the SST, there were no ROI 
      task activation differences. Bayes factor analysis determined the null findings 
      were at least three times more likely than the alternative hypothesis for all 
      ROIs. CONCLUSIONS: Impulsivity under periods of heightened affect, but not motor 
      response inhibitions, characterized anxious/depressed individuals who use 
      cannabis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) do not always respond to 
      currently available treatments, and evaluation of new candidate pharmacotherapies 
      is indicated. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an over-the-counter supplement, has shown 
      promise in treating a variety of substance use disorders, but little research has 
      evaluated its merits as a treatment for AUD. This secondary analysis from the 
      National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network examined the effects of NAC 
      versus placebo on alcohol use among participants with cannabis use disorder (CUD) 
      enrolled in a 12-week, multi-site cannabis cessation trial. METHODS: Participants 
      (N = 302, ages 18-50) were randomized to double-blind NAC (1200 mg, twice daily) 
      or placebo. Neither alcohol use nor desire for alcohol cessation were 
      requirements for participation. Participants that returned for at least one 
      treatment visit and had recorded alcohol use data (i.e., total drinks per week, 
      drinking days per week, and binge drinking days per week) were included in the 
      analysis (n = 277). RESULTS: Compared to the placebo group, participants in the 
      NAC group had increased odds of between-visit alcohol abstinence [OR = 1.37; 95% 
      CI = 1.06-1.78; p = 0.019], fewer drinks per week [RR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.48-0.99; 
      p = 0.045], and fewer drinking days per week [RR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.51-0.92; 
      p = 0.014]. Changes in concurrent cannabis use amounts were not correlated to any 
      of the alcohol use variables. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that NAC may be 
      effective at reducing consumption of alcohol by ∼30% among treatment-seeking 
      adults with CUD, suggesting a need for further trials focused on the effects of 
      NAC on alcohol consumption among individuals seeking treatment for AUD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prevalence of regular cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) 
      have increased in the past two decades, but treatment-seeking is low and extant 
      brief interventions do not target causal risk factors implicated in etiological 
      models of addiction. Elevated distress intolerance (DI) is one risk factor that 
      has been empirically linked with greater CUD severity and maintenance in regular 
      users, but, to our knowledge, research has never targeted it in a brief 
      intervention among cannabis users with CUD or at high risk. The current RCT 
      evaluated the impact of a DI intervention (i.e., Distress Tolerance Intervention 
      [DTI]) compared to a healthy habits control intervention (i.e., Healthy Video 
      Control [HVC]) on DI and cannabis use outcomes. METHOD: We randomized cannabis 
      users with high DI (N = 60) to the DTI or HVC condition and they received two 
      computerized intervention sessions. We assessed relief cannabis craving at pre- 
      and post-treatment; and we assessed DI, cannabis use coping motives, use-related 
      problems, and use frequency at pre- and post-treatment as well as one- and 
      four-month follow-ups. We assessed CUD symptoms via interviews at pre-treatment 
      and four-month follow-up. RESULTS: Significant, durable reductions in DI and all 
      cannabis use outcomes occurred in both conditions. Compared to the HVC condition, 
      the DTI led to greater reductions in use frequency during the treatment period. 
      Reductions in self-reported DI were correlated with reductions in coping motives 
      and CUD symptoms. CONCLUSION: The DTI's impact on all outcomes was largely 
      comparable to the control condition, though it may have utility as an adjunctive 
      intervention.

TI  - Acute Effects of Smoked and Vaporized Cannabis in Healthy Adults Who Infrequently 
      Use Cannabis: A Crossover Trial.
PG  - e184841
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.4841 [doi]
LID - e184841
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Vaporization is an increasingly popular method for cannabis 
      administration, and policy changes have increased adult access to cannabis 
      drastically. Controlled examinations of cannabis vaporization among adults with 
      infrequent current cannabis use patterns (>30 days since last use) are needed. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acute dose effects of smoked and vaporized cannabis 
      using controlled administration methods. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      within-participant, double-blind, crossover study was conducted from June 2016 to 
      January 2017 at the Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit, Johns Hopkins 
      University School of Medicine, and included 17 healthy adults. Six smoked and 
      vaporized outpatient experimental sessions (1-week washout between sessions) were 
      completed in clusters (order counterbalanced across participants); dose order was 
      randomized within each cluster. INTERVENTIONS: Cannabis containing 
      Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) doses of 0 mg, 10 mg, and 25 mg was vaporized and 
      smoked by each participant. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change from baseline 
      scores for subjective drug effects, cognitive and psychomotor performance, vital 
      signs, and blood THC concentration. RESULTS: The sample included 17 healthy 
      adults (mean [SD] age, 27.3 [5.7] years; 9 men and 8 women) with no cannabis use 
      in the prior month (mean [SD] days since last cannabis use, 398 [437] days). 
      Inhalation of cannabis containing 10 mg of THC produced discriminative drug 
      effects (mean [SD] ratings on a 100-point visual analog scale, smoked: 46 [26]; 
      vaporized: 69 [26]) and modest impairment of cognitive functioning. The 25-mg 
      dose produced significant drug effects (mean [SD] ratings, smoked: 66 [29]; 
      vaporized: 78 [24]), increased incidence of adverse effects, and pronounced 
      impairment of cognitive and psychomotor ability (eg, significant decreased task 
      performance compared with placebo in vaporized conditions). Vaporized cannabis 
      resulted in qualitatively stronger drug effects for most pharmacodynamic outcomes 
      and higher peak concentrations of THC in blood, compared with equal doses of 
      smoked cannabis (25-mg dose: smoked, 10.2 ng/mL; vaporized, 14.4 ng/mL). Blood 
      THC concentrations and heart rate peaked within 30 minutes after cannabis 
      administration and returned to baseline within 3 to 4 hours. Several subjective 
      drug effects and observed cognitive and psychomotor impairments persisted for up 
      to 6 hours on average. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vaporized and smoked cannabis 
      produced dose-orderly drug effects, which were stronger when vaporized. These 
      data can inform regulatory and clinical decisions surrounding the use of cannabis 
      among adults with little or no prior cannabis exposure. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Genetic counselling for the prevention of mental health consequences of cannabis 
      use: A randomized controlled trial-within-cohort.
PG  - 1306-1314
LID - 10.1111/eip.13082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis use is a risk factor for severe mental illness. However, 
      cannabis does not affect everyone equally. Genetic information may help identify 
      individuals who are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of cannabis on mental 
      health. A common genetic variant within the AKT1 gene selectively increases risk 
      of psychosis, only among those who use cannabis. Therapeutically oriented genetic 
      counselling may enable us to reduce cannabis exposure among genetically sensitive 
      individuals. METHODS: Using a trial-within-cohort design, we aim to test if 
      genetic counselling, including the option to receive AKT1 rs2494732 genotype, 
      reduces cannabis use. To this end, we have designed a genetic counselling 
      intervention: Interdisciplinary approach to Maximize Adolescent potential: 
      Genetic counselling Intervention to reduce Negative Environmental effects 
      (IMAGINE). RESULTS: IMAGINE will be implemented in a cohort of children and youth 
      enriched for familial risk for major mood and psychotic disorders. Approximately 
      110 eligible individuals aged 12-21 years will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to be 
      offered a single genetic counselling session with a board-certified genetic 
      counsellor, or not. Allocated youth will also be invited to attend a follow-up 
      session approximately 1 month following the intervention. The primary outcome 
      will be cannabis use (measured by self-report or urine screen) at subsequent 
      annual assessments as part of the larger cohort study. Secondary outcomes include 
      intervention acceptability and psychopathology. CONCLUSION: This study represents 
      the first translational application of a gene-environment interaction to improve 
      mental health and test an intervention with potential public health benefits. 
      This study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03601026).

TI  - A preliminary test of a brief intervention to lessen young adults' cannabis use: 
      Episode-level smartphone data highlights the role of protective behavioral 
      strategies and exercise.

AB  - Brief interventions are increasingly being used to help young adults to moderate 
      their cannabis use. We conducted a randomized clinical trial of a brief (4 weekly 
      sessions), in-person intervention that included a smartphone application that 
      reinforced the use of protective behavioral strategies (PBSs) to lessen cannabis 
      use. Young adults (N = 37; 24 men) who regularly used cannabis were randomized to 
      2 intervention conditions rooted in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and 
      motivational enhancement therapy (MET). Along with learning CBT + MET strategies, 
      participants in 1 of the conditions were instructed to engage in exercise. All 
      participants used smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment to provide 
      episode-level reports about use of cannabis and PBSs. Two multilevel structural 
      equation models were run to test the study hypotheses that (a) cannabis use would 
      be reduced over the course of the 6-month study, (b) reductions would be 
      moderated by intervention condition, and (c) episode-level PBS use would predict 
      episode-level cannabis use. Participants reduced their cannabis use by 
      approximately 1 half of a standard joint per time point. The MET + CBT + Exercise 
      condition reduced cannabis use to a greater degree than did the MET + CBT 
      condition. With episode-level PBS use in the model, reductions in cannabis use 
      were independent of intervention condition. Our findings suggest that young 
      adults will engage with a smartphone app that serves as a component of an 
      in-person intervention to moderate their cannabis use. Intervention content that 
      promotes the use of PBSs and exercise facilitates reductions in cannabis use.

AB  - Few studies have evaluated treatment for co-occurring cannabis and tobacco use. 
      The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary 
      effectiveness of varenicline for co-occurring cannabis and tobacco use. 
      Participants who reported cannabis use on ≥5 days per week were recruited from an 
      urban, outpatient opioid treatment program (OTP). Participants were randomized to 
      either four weeks of standard OTP clinical care (SCC; medication-assisted 
      treatment for opioid use disorder and individual behavioral counseling), followed 
      by four weeks of SCC plus varenicline (SCC+VT), or to four weeks of SCC+VT 
      followed by four weeks of SCC. All participants contributed feasibility and 
      outcome data during both study phases. Of 193 persons screened, seven were 
      enrolled. Retention at eight weeks was 100%. No adverse effects prompted 
      varenicline discontinuation. Participants reported lower cannabis craving during 
      the SCC+VT phase compared to baseline, and lower frequencies and quantities of 
      cannabis use compared to both baseline and the SCC alone phase. In the SCC+VT 
      phase, participants also reported fewer cigarettes per day. Among persons with 
      co-occurring cannabis and tobacco use, varenicline is well-tolerated and may 
      reduce cannabis craving, cannabis use, and tobacco use.

TI  - Brain imaging of cannabinoid type I (CB(1) ) receptors in women with cannabis use 
      disorder and male and female healthy controls.
PG  - e13061
LID - 10.1111/adb.13061 [doi]
AB  - Cannabis effects are predominantly mediated by pharmacological actions on 
      cannabinoid type 1 (CB(1) ) receptors. Prior positron emission tomography (PET) 
      studies in individuals who use cannabis included almost exclusively males. PET 
      studies in females are needed because there are sex differences in cannabis 
      effects, progression to cannabis use disorder (CUD), and withdrawal symptom 
      severity. Females with CUD (N = 10) completed two double-blind cannabis smoking 
      sessions (Session 1: placebo; Session 2: active), and acute cannabis effects were 
      assessed. After Session 2, participants underwent 3 days of monitored cannabis 
      abstinence; mood, craving, and withdrawal symptoms were assessed and a PET scan 
      (radiotracer: [(11) C]OMAR) followed. [(11) C]OMAR Distribution volume (V(T) ) 
      from these participants was compared with V(T) of age/BMI-similar female 
      non-users of cannabis ("healthy controls"; N = 10). V(T) was also compared 
      between female and male healthy controls (N = 7). Females with CUD displayed 
      significantly lower V(T) than female healthy controls in specific brain regions 
      (hippocampus, amygdala, cingulate, and insula). Amygdala V(T) was negatively 
      correlated with mood changes (anger/hostility) during abstinence, but V(T) was 
      not correlated with other withdrawal symptoms or cannabis effects. Among healthy 
      controls, females had significantly higher V(T) than males in all brain regions 
      examined. Chronic cannabis use appears to foster downregulation of CB(1) 
      receptors in women, as observed previously in men, and there are inherent sex 
      differences in CB(1) availability. Future studies should elucidate the time 
      course of CB(1) downregulation among females who use cannabis and examine the 
      relation between CB(1) availability and cannabis effects among other populations 
      (e.g., infrequent users; medicinal users).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a web-based 
      treatment program with therapist guidance for adults and adolescents with regular 
      cannabis use from the general population. METHODS: A double blinded randomized 
      controlled trial with a parallel group design was conducted (intervention group 
      n = 151, wait-list control group n = 152). Follow-up 12 weeks from treatment 
      commencement of a 13-module intervention. The primary outcome was frequency of 
      cannabis use. Time by group interaction effects were modeled using generalized 
      estimated equations and the instrumental variable approach was used to estimate 
      the effect of intervention adherence. RESULTS: At follow-up, the intention to 
      treat (ITT) analyses did not show any significant time by group effects. A 
      significant association between intervention adherence and scores on the cannabis 
      abuse screening test (CAST) was found. Secondary analysis excluding participants 
      who had received other professional help revealed time by group effects for 
      secondary outcomes gram cannabis consumed past week, number of dependency 
      criteria and CAST score. Due to methodological limitations, these latter results 
      should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we did not find a 
      web-based treatment program with therapist guidance to be more effective than a 
      waiting-list in reducing frequency of cannabis use. Trial registration The trial 
      was pre-registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02408640) April 3, 2015.

AB  - Some adult cannabis users report negative consequences of use but do not seek 
      treatment. Nonjudgmental, brief interventions incorporating motivational 
      interviewing techniques may be able to reach users who otherwise would not seek 
      treatment and increase their motivation to change use. Previous studies have 
      shown brief interventions with this population are efficacious in reducing use, 
      but the absolute amount of change has not clearly translated into meaningful 
      reductions in associated negative consequences. The current study used a 
      marijuana check-up (MCU) model to attract nontreatment-seeking adults who used 
      cannabis at levels that may have caused negative consequences. The study randomly 
      assigned participants to 2-session (n = 93) and 6-session (n = 93) versions of 
      the intervention and followed them for 12 months. The study designed the extended 
      6-session condition to build on the efficacy of the previously tested 2-session 
      intervention. The study hypothesized that the opportunity to continue to consider 
      the consequences of cannabis use would have the greatest impact on those who were 
      in earlier stages of readiness for change. We used cognitive behavioral 
      techniques to assist with change efforts when indicated. Results showed 
      significant reductions in the frequency and daily duration of cannabis use at all 
      follow-ups in both intervention conditions. The extended 6-session condition 
      produced greater change only on a measure of the number of periods of the day in 
      which cannabis was used. Reductions in dependence symptoms and problems related 
      to cannabis use occurred in both conditions, but there was no effect of 
      intervention condition. Participants who were less ready to make changes at the 
      outset decreased use and negative consequences the least. Results suggested that 
      some benefit of the extended session format of the check-up in reducing daily 
      use, but the lack of a corresponding reduction in consequences suggested that the 
      original 2-session MCU may be more cost effective.

      Stimulant Reduction Intervention using Dosed Exercise (STRIDE) Randomized Control 
      Trial.

AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of vigorous intensity, high 
      dose exercise (DEI) on cannabis use among stimulant users compared to a health 
      education intervention (HEI) using data from the Stimulant Reduction Intervention 
      using Dosed Exercise, National Institute of Drug Abuse National Drug Treatment 
      Clinical Trials Network Protocol Number 0037 (STRIDE). METHODS: Adults (N = 302) 
      enrolled in the STRIDE randomized clinical trial were randomized to either the 
      DEI or the HEI. Interventions included supervised sessions three times a week 
      during the Acute phase (12 weeks) and once a week during the Follow-up phase (6 
      months). Cannabis use was measured at each assessment via Timeline Follow Back 
      and urine drug screens. Cannabis use was compared between the groups during the 
      Acute and Follow-up phases using both the intent-to-treat sample and a complier 
      average causal effects (CACE) analysis. FINDINGS: Approximately 43% of the sample 
      reported cannabis use at baseline. The difference in cannabis use between the DEI 
      and HEI groups during the Acute phase was not significant. During the Follow-up 
      phase, the days of cannabis use was significantly lower among those in the DEI 
      group (1.20 days) compared to the HEI group (2.15 days; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: 
      For those who adhered to the exercise intervention, vigorous intensity, high dose 
      exercise resulted in less cannabis use. Results suggest that there were no 
      significant short-term differences in cannabis use between the groups. Further 
      study on the long-term impact of exercise as a treatment to reduce cannabis use 
      should be considered.

TI  - A pilot randomized clinical trial of Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia to 
      reduce problematic cannabis use among trauma-exposed young adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Insomnia symptoms may be an important etiological factor for 
      substance use disorders; however, whether improving sleep leads to reductions in 
      problematic substance use among at-risk populations remains unclear. METHOD: As 
      such, the current pilot study used a randomized controlled design to test the 
      effects of Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI) against a waitlist 
      control among a sample of trauma-exposed young adults with elevated insomnia 
      symptoms who regularly use cannabis (N = 56). RESULTS: Intent-to-treat multilevel 
      modeling analyses indicated that BBTI may be more efficacious than waitlist 
      control in reducing self-reported insomnia symptoms, with large effects three 
      months post-treatment (d = 1.34). Further, our initial evidence suggested that 
      BBTI resulted in reductions in cannabis-related problems with medium to large 
      effects at three months post-treatment (d = 0.75). The current pilot analyses 
      indicated BBTI also reduced cravings to use cannabis to reduce negative emotions 
      in response to trauma cues with a large effect size. CONCLUSION: This pilot study 
      suggests BBTI may be efficacious not only in improving insomnia symptoms among 
      cannabis users but also in reducing cannabis-related problems and cravings over 
      three months. Future research should replicate these results in a larger, fully 
      powered sample with improved follow-up rates designed to test temporal mediation 
      using multimethod assessments of insomnia symptoms and problematic cannabis use. 
      Overall, BBTI may be a promising intervention for trauma-exposed cannabis users 
      to improve sleep and reduce cannabis-related problems.

TI  - Effects of a Brief Web-Based "Social Norms"-Intervention on Alcohol, Tobacco and 
      Cannabis Use Among German University Students: Results of a Cluster-Controlled 
      Trial Conducted at Eight Universities.
PG  - 659875

LID - 659875
AB  - Background and Aim: "Social norms" (SN)-interventions are aimed at changing 
      existing misperceptions regarding peer substance use by providing feedback on 
      actual norms, thereby affecting personal substance use. It is unknown whether 
      SN-intervention effects previously demonstrated in US students can be replicated 
      in German students. The aim of the INSIST-study was to examine the effects of a 
      web-based SN-intervention on substance use. Design: Cluster-controlled trial. 
      Setting: Eight Universities in Germany. Participants and Measurements: Students 
      were recruited at four intervention vs. four delayed intervention control 
      Universities. 4,463 students completed baseline, 1,255 students (59% female) 
      completed both baseline and 5-months follow-up web-based surveys on personal and 
      perceived peer substance use. Intervention participants received feedback 
      contrasting personal and perceived peer use with previously assessed use and 
      perceptions of same-sex, same-university peers. Intervention effects were 
      assessed via multivariable mixed logistic regression models. Findings: Relative 
      to controls, reception of SN-feedback was associated with higher odds for 
      decreased alcohol use (OR: 1.91, 95% CI 1.42-2.56). This effect was most 
      pronounced in students overestimating peer use at baseline and under or 
      accurately estimating it at follow-up (OR: 6.28, 95% CI 2.00-19.8). The OR was 
      1.33 (95% CI 0.67-2.65) for decreased cannabis use in students at intervention 
      Universities and was statistically significant at 1.70 (95% CI 1.13-2.55) when 
      contrasting unchanged and decreased with increased use. Regarding tobacco use and 
      episodes of drunkenness, no intervention effects were found. Conclusions: This 
      study was the first cluster-controlled trial suggesting beneficial effects of 
      web-based SN-intervention on alcohol and cannabis use in a large sample of German 
      University students. Clinical Trial Registration: The trial registration number 
      of the INSIST-study is DRKS00007635 at the "German Clinical Trials Register."

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cannabis and alcohol use are correlated behaviors among youth. It is 
      not known whether discontinuation of cannabis use is associated with changes in 
      alcohol use. This study assessed alcohol use in youth before, during, and after 4 
      weeks of paid cannabis abstinence. METHODS: Healthy, non-treatment seeking, 
      cannabis users (n = 160), aged 14-25 years, 84% of whom used alcohol in the last 
      month, were enrolled for a 4-week study with a 2-4 week follow-up. Participants 
      were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of either biochemically-verified cannabis 
      abstinence achieved through a contingency management framework (CB-Abst) or 
      monitoring with no abstinence requirement (CB-Mon). Participants were assessed at 
      baseline and approximately 4, 6, 10, 17, 24, and 31 days after enrollment. A 
      follow-up visit with no cannabis abstinence requirement for CB-Abst was conducted 
      after 2-4 weeks. RESULTS: Sixty percent of individuals assigned to the CB-Abst 
      condition increased in frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption during the 
      4-week period of incentivized cannabis abstinence. As a whole, CB-Abst increased 
      by a mean of 0.6 drinking days and 0.2 drinks per day in the initial week of 
      abstinence (p's < 0.006). There was no evidence for further increases in drinking 
      frequency or quantity during the 30-day abstinence period (p's > 0.53). There was 
      no change in drinking frequency or quantity during the 4-week monitoring or 
      follow-up periods among CB-Mon. CONCLUSIONS: On average, 4 weeks of incentivized 
      (i.e., paid) cannabis abstinence among non-treatment seeking youth was associated 
      with increased frequency and amount of alcohol use in week 1 that was sustained 
      over 4 weeks and resolved with resumption of cannabis use. However, there was 
      notable variability in individual-level response, with 60% increasing in alcohol 
      use and 23% actually decreasing in alcohol use during cannabis abstinence. 
      Findings suggest that increased alcohol use during cannabis abstinence among 
      youth merits further study to determine whether this behavior occurs among 
      treatment seeking youth and its clinical significance.

AB  - Driving after cannabis use (DACU) is a significant public health concern and 
      represents one of the riskiest cannabis-related behaviors. Though years of 
      research has demonstrated that cannabis use impairs driving ability, many college 
      students report believing that cannabis use does not impair their driving 
      abilities. This perception of low danger may contribute to a permissive attitude 
      toward DACU. The present proof-of-concept pilot study examined the preliminary 
      efficacy of a mobile phone-based intervention with personalized feedback and text 
      messaging to increase perceptions of dangerousness of DACU. Participants were 77 
      college cannabis users (65.8% women; average age = 21.2; 88.3% Caucasian) who 
      endorsed DACU at least three times in the past 3 months. After completing 
      baseline measures, participants were randomly assigned to one of three 
      conditions: (a) personalized feedback plus interactive text messaging (PFT), (b) 
      personalized feedback only (PF), or (c) informational control (IC). Participants 
      completed outcome measures 3 months post intervention. Repeated measures mixed 
      models revealed that compared to those in the IC condition, cannabis users in the 
      PFT condition reported significantly greater increases over time in the 
      perception of dangerousness of DACU. These findings provide initial support for 
      the short-term efficacy of a mobile phone-based intervention for changing 
      perceptions related to dangerousness of DACU among college cannabis users.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As long-term use of medicinal and recreational cannabis becomes more 
      common and concentrations of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in cannabis 
      increase, it is timely to identify strategies to counteract the cognitive effects 
      of cannabinoids. OBJECTIVE: Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor 
      approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. This study 
      aimed to investigate the feasibility of galantamine administration to individuals 
      with cannabis use disorder (CUD), and the effects of galantamine on cognition. We 
      hypothesized galantamine would be well tolerated and would not have procognitive 
      effects in the absence of acute cannabis intoxication. METHODS: Thirty 
      individuals with CUD (73.5% male, 26.5% female) participated in a randomized, 
      double-blind, parallel-group trial. Participants completed a baseline session 
      followed by a 10-day outpatient treatment period, during which they received 
      either 8 mg/day of galantamine orally or placebo. Cognitive assessments were 
      conducted at three time points and self-reported measures that may impact 
      cognitive performance (cannabis withdrawal, craving, and mood) were completed at 
      six time points. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in demographic 
      and baseline variables between groups (galantamine vs. placebo). There were no 
      significant adverse effects from galantamine. Cannabis withdrawal and craving 
      continuously decreased over the study. We saw evidence of a modest improvement in 
      cognitive outcomes during the 10-day period, exemplified by a statistically 
      significant increase in measures of response inhibition (increased median 
      reaction time on the Stop Signal Task), and a trend for improvement in measures 
      of attention (increased RVP A'), for both groups. Analyses did not show, however, 
      a significant main effect for treatment or treatment-by-time interactions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot study support the feasibility of the 
      administration of galantamine for individuals with CUD. Adequately powered, 
      randomized, placebo-controlled trials are required to investigate the potential 
      of galantamine to improve cognitive deficits associated with CUD.

TI  - The Partners for Change Outcome Management System in the psychotherapeutic 
      treatment of cannabis use: a pilot effectiveness randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 633-640
LID - 10.1080/08039488.2021.1921265 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of the 
      Partners for Change Outcome Management System (PCOMS) in improving the retention 
      rate and reducing drug use in a clinic for drug use treatment. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: One-hundred outpatients with cannabis use as the primary presenting 
      problem were randomized to either the PCOMS (n = 51) or treatment as usual (TAU; 
      n = 49). Eight weekly psychotherapy sessions were planned in both conditions. The 
      primary outcome was treatment retention measured as the rate of attendance to 
      planned treatment sessions and dropout. The secondary outcomes were current 
      cannabis and other drug use assessed with the European Addiction Severity Index 
      (EuropASI). Several explorative outcomes were analyzed. Blind assessments of drug 
      use were conducted three and six months after baseline. Outcome analyses were 
      conducted on both the treated sample with at least one psychotherapy session 
      (n = 82) and the intention-to-treat sample (n = 100). RESULTS: The results showed 
      no incremental effect of the PCOMS compared to the TAU condition, for neither 
      treatment retention, drug use, or therapeutic alliance. CONCLUSION: The main 
      findings align with previous studies that have found no effect of the PCOMS when 
      employing outcome measures independent from the PCOMS intervention. The results 
      are interpreted with caution due to implementation difficulties, which at the 
      same time suggest challenges when employing the PCOMS in large outpatient clinics 
      for drug use treatment.

TI  - Abstinence and reduced frequency of use are associated with improvements in 
      quality of life among treatment-seekers with cannabis use disorder.
PG  - 101-107
LID - 10.1111/ajad.12660 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Many patients with cannabis use disorder (CUD) do not 
      achieve or do not have abstinence as a goal of treatment, rather they reduce 
      their use. Assessing outcome measures as they relate to functioning and 
      reductions in cannabis use is an important area of study. Quality of life (QoL) 
      shows promise as one such measure. Past studies have demonstrated gender 
      differences in QoL and CUD. We aim to assess (1) the relationship between 
      cannabis use and QoL and (2) gender effects in an outpatient medication treatment 
      study for CUD. METHODS: Data from an 11-weeks, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
      trial of lofexidine and dronabinol for CUD (n = 62) was analyzed. Pearson's 
      correlations between baseline QoL as measured with the Quality of Life, 
      Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (QLES-Q-SF) and cannabis use 
      assessed with modified timeline follow-back (TLFB) were examined. Multiple linear 
      regression models of cannabis use on end of study QLES-Q-SF were analyzed, while 
      adjusting for baseline QLES-Q-SF, study arm, and gender. Moderation effects with 
      gender were also tested. RESULTS: No significant association between baseline 
      cannabis use and QoL was found. End of study abstinence (F(1,47)   (=)  8.34, 
      p = .006) and reduced proportion of using days (F(1,47)  = 9.48, p = .004) were 
      each significantly associated with end of study QoL. Reduction in grams (F(1,27) 
       = 0.25, p = .62) was not associated with QoL at end of study. Gender was not a 
      significant moderator. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Abstinence and lower frequency 
      of use are associated with higher QoL, regardless of gender. SCIENTIFIC 
      SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first time QoL has been demonstrated to change over the 
      course of CUD medication treatment. QoL is an important outcome in CUD treatment.

TI  - Who responds best to text-delivered cannabis use disorder treatment? A randomized 
      clinical trial with young adults.
PG  - 699-709
LID - 10.1037/adb0000403 [doi]
AB  - Young adults ages 18 to 25 have the highest percentage (5%) of cannabis use 
      disorder (CUD) among all age groups, and are the least likely to receive 
      treatment compared with other age groups. Because this population is in need of 
      creative approaches for treatment engagement, we tested Peer Network 
      Counseling-txt (PNC-txt), a 4-week, automated text-delivered cannabis treatment 
      that focuses on close peer relations with 96 treatment seeking young adults. 
      Participants meeting CUD criteria were randomized to PNC-txt, or assessment only 
      control condition and followed for 3-months. At 3-months, the PNC-txt group 
      reduced number of heavy cannabis-use days and relationship problems due to 
      cannabis use compared with controls. Subgroup analyses were conducted with cases 
      having more and fewer CUD symptoms than the full sample. For cases with fewer 
      symptoms, but not for those with more, PNC-txt reduced past 30-day use, urges to 
      use, memory problems, and relationship problems due to cannabis use compared with 
      controls. Treatment satisfaction data from the full sample indicated that 
      participants thought the intervention texts helped them reduce or manage their 
      cannabis use and increased their understanding of the negative relational effects 
      associated with ongoing cannabis use. Findings provide evidence of the efficacy 
      of PNC-txt in treating CUD in young adults, support clinically targeting peer 
      relations, and suggest that PNC-txt may be most helpful for those with mild to 
      moderate CUD severity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights

TI  - The Role of Acculturation and Alcohol Problems on Frequency of Cannabis Use Among 
      Latinas at Risk of an Alcohol-Exposed Pregnancy.
PG  - 1980-1990
LID - 10.1080/10826084.2019.1625399 [doi]
AB  - Background: Along with alcohol, cannabis is one of the most commonly used 
      substances among women of childbearing age. Recent studies indicate detrimental 
      effects of prenatal cannabis use. Because many women use these substances before 
      realizing they are pregnant, these serious health consequences for women and 
      their offspring are of great concern. Despite the recent upsurge in cannabis use, 
      little is known about individual and sociocultural factors that may contribute to 
      risk of a cannabis-exposed pregnancy, particularly among Latinas of child-bearing 
      age also at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP). Objectives: Examine the 
      relationships of acculturation, alcohol use, alcohol problems, and psychological 
      distress with frequency of cannabis use among adult Latinas at risk of an AEP. 
      Methods: The hypothesized model included 76 Latinas and was analyzed using path 
      analysis. The study used baseline data from a randomized controlled trial of an 
      intervention targeting risky drinking and tobacco use among women at risk of an 
      AEP in primary care clinics. Results: Greater acculturation was associated with 
      more frequent cannabis use and greater psychological distress. There was a 
      positive indirect relationship between acculturation and alcohol use and alcohol 
      problems through psychological distress. Greater alcohol problems were associated 
      with more frequent cannabis use. Greater psychological distress and alcohol use 
      were indirectly related to more frequent cannabis use through alcohol problems. 
      Conclusions: Findings underscore the critical role of acculturation and 
      alcohol-related problems in cannabis use frequency and have relevant implications 
      for preventive efforts addressing cannabis use among Latinas at risk of an AEP.

TI  - Cigarette Smokers Versus Cousers of Cannabis and Cigarettes: Exposure to 
      Toxicants.
PG  - 1383-1389
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntz199 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cannabis and tobacco couse is common and could expose users to 
      higher levels of toxicants. No studies have examined biomarkers of toxicant 
      exposure in cousers of cannabis and cigarettes, compared with cigarette smokers 
      (CS). AIMS AND METHODS: Adult daily CS were recruited from 10 US sites for a 
      study of reduced nicotine cigarettes. In this analysis of baseline data, 
      participants were categorized as either cousers of cannabis and tobacco (cousers; 
      N = 167; urine positive for 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ 9-tetrahydrocannnabinol and 
      self-reported cannabis use ≥1×/week), or CS (N = 911; negative urine and no 
      self-reported cannabis use). Participants who did not meet either definition (N = 
      172) were excluded. Self-reported tobacco and cannabis use and tobacco and/or 
      combustion-related biomarkers of exposure were compared between groups. RESULTS: 
      Compared to CS, cousers were younger (couser Mage = 38.96, SD = 13.01; CS Mage = 
      47.22, SD = 12.72; p < .001) and more likely to be male (cousers = 67.7%, CS = 
      51.9%, p < .001). There were no group differences in self-reported 
      cigarettes/day, total nicotine equivalents, or breath carbon monoxide, but 
      cousers had greater use of non-cigarette tobacco products. Compared to CS, 
      cousers had higher concentrations of 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid, 
      2-cyanoethylmercapturic acid, S-phenylmercapturic acid, 
      3-hydroxy-1-methylpropylmercapturic acid (ps < .05), and phenanthrene tetraol (p 
      < .001). No biomarkers were affected by number of cannabis use days/week or days 
      since last cannabis use during baseline (ps > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Cousers had 
      higher concentrations of biomarkers of exposure than CS, but similar number of 
      cigarettes per day and nicotine exposure. Additional studies are needed to 
      determine whether cannabis and/or alternative tobacco products are driving the 
      increased toxicant exposure. IMPLICATIONS: Cousers of cannabis and tobacco appear 
      to be exposed to greater levels of harmful chemicals (ie, volatile organic 
      compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), but similar levels of nicotine 
      as CS. It is unclear if the higher levels of toxicant exposure in cousers are due 
      to cannabis use or the increased use of alternative tobacco products compared 
      with CS. It is important for studies examining biomarkers of exposure among CS to 
      account for cannabis use as it may have a significant impact on outcomes. 
      Additionally, further research is needed examining exposure to harmful chemicals 
      among cannabis users.

TI  - A contingency management intervention to reduce cannabis use and time to relapse 
      in early psychosis: the CIRCLE RCT.
PG  - 1-108
LID - 10.3310/hta23450 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis is the most prevalent illicit substance among people with 
      psychosis, and its use is associated with poorer clinical and social outcomes. 
      However, so far, there has been limited evidence that any treatment is effective 
      for reducing use. Contingency management (CM) is an incentive-based intervention 
      for substance misuse that has a substantial evidence base across a range of 
      substances and cohorts. However, to date there have been no randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) of CM as a treatment for cannabis use specifically in psychosis. 
      OBJECTIVE: To conduct a RCT investigating the clinical effectiveness and 
      cost-effectiveness of CM in reducing cannabis use among Early Intervention in 
      Psychosis (EIP) service users. DESIGN: The CIRCLE (Contingency Intervention for 
      Reduction of Cannabis in Early Psychosis) trial was a rater-blinded, multicentre 
      RCT with two arms. Participants were randomised 1 : 1 to either an CM arm, in 
      which participants received CM for cannabis use alongside an optimised 
      treatment-as-usual programme including structured psychoeducation, or a control 
      arm in which participants received the treatment as usual only. SETTING: EIP 
      services across the Midlands and the south-east of England. PARTICIPANTS: The 
      main eligibility criteria were EIP service users with a history of psychosis, 
      aged 18-36 years, and having used cannabis at least once per week during 12 of 
      the previous 24 weeks. INTERVENTION: The CM intervention offered financial 
      incentives (i.e. shopping vouchers) for cannabis abstinence over 12 once-weekly 
      sessions, confirmed using urinalysis. The maximum value in vouchers that 
      participants could receive was £240. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was 
      time to relapse, operationalised as admission to an acute mental health service 
      or hospital. The primary outcome was assessed at 18 months post inclusion using 
      electronic patient records. Secondary outcomes assessed the clinical 
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention, for which data were 
      collected at 3 and 18 months. RESULTS: A total of 278 participants were 
      randomised to the CM arm and 273 were randomised to the control arm. In total, 
      530 (96%) participants were followed up for the primary outcome. There was no 
      significant difference in time to admission between trial arms by 18 months 
      following consent (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.40). 
      There were no statistically significant differences in most secondary outcomes, 
      including cannabis use, at either follow-up assessment. There were 58 serious 
      adverse events, comprising 52 inpatient episodes, five deaths and one arrest. 
      LIMITATIONS: Participant retention was low at 18 months, limiting the assessment 
      of secondary outcomes. A different CM intervention design or reward level may 
      have been effective. CONCLUSIONS: The CM intervention did not appear to be 
      effective in reducing cannabis use and acute relapse among people with early 
      psychosis and problematic cannabis use. FUTURE WORK: Cannabis use is still a 
      significant clinical concern in this population. A pressing need remains to 
      identify suitable treatments. A wider perspective on the social circumstances of 
      young people with psychosis may be needed for a successful intervention to be 
      found. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN33576045. FUNDING:

OAB - A large proportion of people with psychosis use cannabis, despite the negative 
      impact that it has on their recovery. So far, a clearly effective way of helping 
      young people in the early stages of psychosis to cut down their cannabis use has 
      not been found. The CIRCLE trial investigated if an approach known as contingency 
      management (CM) would be beneficial for this group. This approach involves 
      offering voucher rewards for not using cannabis. It has been effective in 
      addressing drug use problems in general, but there is not much evidence about its 
      effects on cannabis use in those with psychosis. A total of 551 service users 
      with psychosis who used cannabis agreed to enter the trial. Half of the sample 
      group was chosen by a chance method to receive CM. The other half formed a 
      comparison group. The CM group received shopping vouchers if urine samples showed 
      that they had not used cannabis for the previous week, measured over 12 weekly 
      sessions. Participants could obtain £240-worth of vouchers if they did not use 
      cannabis during the treatment period. The participants in both groups were also 
      offered a six-session psychoeducation programme about the pros and cons of 
      cannabis use and ways to reduce use of it. The main comparison in the trial was 
      the average length of time in each group before a relapse of psychosis occurred, 
      which was recorded for each participant over 18 months after they joined the 
      trial. The results found no difference between the two trial groups in this 
      measure. Furthermore, there were no differences found between the groups in terms 
      of the levels of cannabis use, clinical symptoms, or engagement with work or 
      education. However, a cost-effectiveness analysis found an 85% chance of CM being 
      more effective than the treatment-as-usual psychoeducation package, which appears 
      to be because of the lower use of inpatient services by those receiving CM. 
      However, it is difficult to understand why this was, because there was no drop in 
      cannabis use. The results suggest that CM is unlikely to be clinically effective 
      and that alternative treatments are still needed.

TI  - A Rebuttal-Based Social Norms-Tailored Cannabis Intervention for At-Risk 
      Adolescents.
PG  - 609-620

AB  - Many past cannabis prevention campaigns have proven largely ineffective due in 
      part to the diversity of adolescents' cannabis-relevant beliefs. The current 
      studies evaluated the impact of a sequential multiple message approach tailored 
      to the usage norms of adolescents expressing negative attitudes toward a cannabis 
      prevention appeal. A multiple-message strategy was implemented-initial 
      unfavorable message evaluations were invalidated using attitudinal rebuttal 
      feedback prior to presenting a third tailored communication. Participants were 
      cannabis-abstinent middle and high school students (ages 11 to 16). Study 1 (N = 
      808) compared effects of gain- and loss-framed messages tailored to each 
      student's normative usage perceptions. In Study 2 (N = 391), students were 
      randomly assigned to receive a tailored or non-tailored message after receiving 
      feedback meant to destabilize anti-message attitudes. For at-risk adolescents in 
      Study 1 who perceived cannabis use as normative, a tailored gain-framed message 
      resulted in the lowest usage intentions (p < .05). In Study 2, a conditional 
      multiple-moderated mediation model showed that for high-risk teens with normative 
      beliefs and pro-cannabis attitudes, exposure to a tailored gain-framed 
      communication was associated with decreased cannabis attitude certainty, and 
      lower usage intentions 2 months later (p < .05). Findings have implications for 
      sequential messaging utilization in mass media campaigns and support the efficacy 
      of tailored messages over a one-size-fits-all media approach. Further, results 
      suggest that systematically weakening resistance to persuasive communications and 
      tailoring messages consistent with individually perceived peer norms is an 
      effective prevention strategy.

TI  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program for Cannabis Use Cessation in First-Episode 
      Psychosis Patients: A 1-Year Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19127325 [doi]
LID - 7325
AB  - Despite the negative influence of cannabis use on the development and prognosis 
      of first-episode psychosis (FEP), there is little evidence on effective specific 
      interventions for cannabis use cessation in FEP. The aim of this study was to 
      compare the efficacy of a specific cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for 
      cannabis cessation (CBT-CC) with treatment as usual (TAU) in FEP cannabis users. 
      In this single-blind, 1-year randomized controlled trial, 65 participants were 
      randomly assigned to CBT-CC or TAU. The primary outcome was the reduction in 
      cannabis use severity. The CBT-CC group had a greater decrease in cannabis use 
      severity and positive psychotic symptoms over time, and a greater improvement in 
      functioning at post-treatment than TAU. The treatment response was also faster in 
      the CBT-CC group, reducing cannabis use, anxiety, positive and general psychotic 
      symptoms, and improving functioning earlier than TAU in the follow-up. Moreover, 
      patients who stopped and/or reduced cannabis use during the follow-up, decreased 
      psychotic symptoms and increased awareness of disease compared to those who 
      continued using cannabis. Early intervention based on a specific CBT for cannabis 
      cessation, may be effective in reducing cannabis use severity, in addition to 
      improving clinical and functional outcomes of FEP cannabis users.

AB  - Alcohol misuse is more prevalent, frequent, and severe among young adults who use 
      cannabis. Treatment of dual alcohol and cannabis users may have mixed results, 
      with some studies reporting that alcohol misuse increases when cannabis use 
      decreases (substance substitution), while others report that alcohol misuse 
      decreases along with decreasing cannabis use (treatment spillover), and others 
      report no association. Additionally, little research tests whether gender 
      differences are found in treatment of dual alcohol and cannabis users, which may 
      be expected given previous alcohol-focused treatments showing larger effects for 
      females. In the current study, we present a secondary analysis of a randomized 
      clinical trial testing a text message-delivered cannabis use disorder (CUD) 
      treatment (peer network counseling text or "PNC-txt"). The trial included 101 
      young adults ages 18-25 who met criteria for CUD. We tested whether alcohol use 
      and binge drinking frequency (4+/5+ drinks for women/men) decreased in response 
      to the PNC-txt treatment, which has previously shown effectiveness in reducing 
      cannabis use days. Latent growth models tested PNC-txt effects on the monthly 
      rate of change in alcohol use and binge drinking across three months. In the full 
      sample, we found no evidence of significant treatment effects on alcohol use 
      (d = -0.07) or binge drinking (d = -0.10). Moderation analyses, however, 
      indicated the PNC-txt effect on both alcohol use and binge drinking differed 
      significantly by gender. PNC-txt led to significantly larger decreases in alcohol 
      use (d = -0.53) and binge drinking days (d = -0.43) across the three months for 
      females, whereas the study saw opposite (but nonsignificant) effects for males 
      (d = 0.30 and 0.16 for alcohol use and binge drinking, respectively). We found no 
      evidence that reductions in alcohol use and binge drinking were associated with 
      cannabis use decreases, arguing against direct substitution or spillover effects. 
      These results provide evidence that treatments focused on cannabis use may have 
      secondary beneficial effects for young-adult alcohol misuse, although such 
      effects may be limited to women.

TI  - Cannabis Use in Adults Who Screen Positive for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity 
      Disorder: CANreduce 2.0 Randomized Controlled Trial Subgroup Analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevalence rates for lifetime cannabis use and cannabis use disorder 
      are much higher in people with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder than in 
      those without. CANreduce 2.0 is an intervention that is generally effective at 
      reducing cannabis use in cannabis misusers. This self-guided web-based 
      intervention (6-week duration) consists of modules grounded in motivational 
      interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate 
      whether the CANreduce 2.0 intervention affects cannabis use patterns and symptom 
      severity in adults who screen positive for attention deficit/hyperactivity 
      disorder more than in those who do not. METHODS: We performed a secondary 
      analysis of data from a previous study with the inclusion criterion of cannabis 
      use at least once weekly over the last 30 days. Adults with and without attention 
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder (based on the Adult Attention 
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder Self-Report screener) who were enrolled to the 
      active intervention arms of CANreduce 2.0 were compared regarding the number of 
      days cannabis was used in the preceding 30 days, the cannabis use disorder 
      identification test score (CUDIT) and the severity of dependence scale score 
      (SDS) at baseline and the 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were Generalized 
      Anxiety Disorder score, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale 
      score, retention, intervention adherence, and safety. RESULTS: Both adults with 
      (n=94) and without (n=273) positive attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
      screening reported significantly reduced frequency (reduction in consumption 
      days: with: mean 11.53, SD 9.28, P<.001; without: mean 8.53, SD 9.4, P<.001) and 
      severity of cannabis use (SDS: with: mean 3.57, SD 3.65, P<.001; without: mean 
      2.47, SD 3.39, P<.001; CUDIT: with: mean 6.38, SD 5.96, P<.001; without: mean 
      5.33, SD 6.05, P<.001), as well as anxiety (with: mean 4.31, SD 4.71, P<.001; 
      without: mean 1.84, SD 4.22, P<.001) and depression (with: mean 10.25, SD 10.54; 
      without: mean 4.39, SD 10.22, P<.001). Those who screened positive for attention 
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder also reported significantly decreased attention 
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder scores (mean 4.65, SD 4.44, P<.001). There were no 
      significant differences in change in use (P=.08), dependence (P=.95), use 
      disorder (P=.85), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder status (P=.84), 
      depression (P=.84), or anxiety (P=.26) between baseline and final follow-up, 
      dependent on positive attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder screening. 
      Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity at baseline was not 
      associated with reduced cannabis use frequency or severity but was linked to 
      greater reductions in depression (Spearman ρ=.33) and anxiety (Spearman ρ=.28). 
      Individuals with positive attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder screening were 
      significantly less likely to fill out the consumption diary (P=.02), but the 
      association between continuous attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom 
      severity and retention (Spearman ρ=-0.10, P=.13) was nonsignificant. There also 
      was no significant intergroup difference in the number of completed modules 
      (with: mean 2.10, SD 2.33; without: mean 2.36, SD 2.36, P=.34), and there was no 
      association with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptom severity 
      (Spearman ρ=-0.09; P=.43). The same was true for the rate of adverse effects 
      (P=.33). CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis users screening positive for attention 
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder may benefit from CANreduce 2.0 to decrease the 
      frequency and severity of cannabis dependence and attenuate symptoms of 
      depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder-related symptoms. This 
      web-based program's advantages include its accessibility for remote users and a 
      personalized counselling option that may contribute to increased adherence and 
      motivation to change among program users. TRIAL REGISTRATION: International

AB  - Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is the most common illicit substance use disorder and 
      individuals with CUD have high rates of comorbid anxiety disorders. Comorbidity 
      between CUD and anxiety disorders is of public health relevance given that 
      although motivation enhancement therapy (MET) combined with cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy (CBT) is an efficacious intervention for CUD, outcomes are worse for 
      patients with elevated anxiety. The current study tested the acceptability and 
      efficacy of the integration of a transdiagnostic anxiety CBT (i.e., treatment of 
      patients with any anxiety disorder) with MET-CBT (integrated cannabis and anxiety 
      reduction treatment, or ICART) for CUD compared to MET-CBT alone. 
      Treatment-seeking cannabis users (56.4% male, M(age) = 23.2, 63.3% non-Hispanic 
      White) with CUD and at least one comorbid anxiety disorder were randomly assigned 
      to ICART (n = 27) or MET-CBT (n = 28). Patients in the ICART condition attended 
      significantly more treatment sessions than those in the MET-CBT condition. 
      Patients in the ICART condition were more likely to be abstinent post-treatment 
      than those in MET-CBT. Further, treatment produced decreases in cannabis use and 
      related problems. Notably, therapy type did not moderate the impact of treatment 
      on frequency of use and related problems. Together, these data suggest that ICART 
      may be at least as efficacious as a gold-standard psychosocial CUD treatment, 
      MET-CBT, for a difficult-to-treat subpopulation of cannabis users.

TI  - Effectiveness of attentional bias modification training as add-on to regular 
      treatment in alcohol and cannabis use disorder: A multicenter randomized control 
      trial.
PG  - e0252494
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0252494 [doi]
LID - e0252494
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attentional bias for substance-relevant cues has been found to 
      contribute to the persistence of addiction. Attentional bias modification (ABM) 
      interventions might, therefore, increase positive treatment outcome and reduce 
      relapse rates. The current study investigated the effectiveness of a newly 
      developed home-delivered, multi-session, internet-based ABM intervention, the 
      Bouncing Image Training Task (BITT), as an add-on to treatment as usual (TAU). 
      METHODS: Participants (N = 169), diagnosed with alcohol or cannabis use disorder, 
      were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the experimental ABM group (50%; 
      TAU+ABM); or the control group (50%; split in two subgroups the TAU+placebo group 
      and TAU-only group, 25% each). Participants completed baseline, post-test, and 6 
      and 12 months follow-up measures of substance use and craving allowing to assess 
      long-term treatment success and relapse rates. In addition, attentional bias 
      (both engagement and disengagement), as well as secondary physical and 
      psychological complaints (depression, anxiety, and stress) were assessed. 
      RESULTS: No significant differences were found between conditions with regard to 
      substance use, craving, relapse rates, attentional bias, or physical and 
      psychological complaints. CONCLUSIONS: The findings may reflect unsuccessful 
      modification of attentional bias, the BITT not targeting the relevant process 
      (engagement vs. disengagement bias), or may relate to the diverse treatment goals 
      of the current sample (i.e., moderation or abstinence). The current findings 
      provide no support for the efficacy of this ABM approach as an add-on to TAU in 
      alcohol or cannabis use disorder. Future studies need to delineate the role of 
      engagement and disengagement bias in the persistence of addiction, and the role 
      of treatment goal in the effectiveness of ABM interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study collected in-depth treatment satisfaction and effectiveness 
      data to provide insight into the mechanisms of behavior change and to identify 
      aspects of a text message- delivered treatment for cannabis use disorder that 
      could be improved. METHODS: Data were collected via a web-based survey from 30 
      young adults (ages 18-25) who were recent participants in a randomized controlled 
      trial of Peer Network Counseling-txt (PNC- txt), a text message treatment for 
      cannabis use disorder. The survey assessed reactions to the text-delivered 
      treatment, changes in cannabis use, reactions to the peer-focused components, and 
      feedback about improvements to the treatment. RESULTS: Nearly all (93%) 
      respondents found PNC-txt to be helpful to their treatment. The majority of the 
      sample (63%) reported that PNC-txt heightened awareness of their cannabis use, 
      and 40% reported a better understanding of problematic use. Fifty percent 
      reported that they use less cannabis than they did prior to the intervention. 
      Seventy percent of respondents stated that it was helpful to answer questions 
      about their close friend group and nearly one- quarter of participants decreased 
      the amount of time spent with "unhealthy" friends. Approximately 85% indicated 
      that thinking about their peer network helped them meet goals of stopping, 
      reducing, or better managing their cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      provide insight into the acceptability of the text-delivered treatment platform 
      and potential mechanisms of behavior change for PNC-txt. The participants 
      provided positive feedback about the treatment and indicated that it helped 
      reduce their cannabis use. Given the acceptability and promising efficacy of 
      PNC-txt, continued research is warranted, particularly with adolescents and with 
      larger samples.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determine whether a culturally tailored contingency management (CM) 
      intervention targeting alcohol abstinence resulted in secondary effects on 
      cannabis use among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults. METHODS: The 
      research team conducted this secondary data analysis to examine cannabis 
      abstinence using data from a randomized control trial of CM for alcohol use among 
      three AI/AN-serving organizations. One hundred and fifty-eight adults met the 
      randomization criteria (i.e., submission of 50% or more urine samples and one 
      alcohol-positive urine test during a 4-week, pre-randomization, observation 
      period). For 12 weeks after randomization, participants received incentives for 
      submitting a urine test negative for ethyl glucuronide (EtG < 150 ng/mL, CM 
      group) or incentives for submitting a urine sample regardless of abstinence 
      (Non-contingent [NC] Control group). Generalized linear mixed effects models 
      assessed group differences in cannabis abstinence during the intervention, 
      verified by urine tetrahydrocannabinol negative tests 
      (11-nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid <50 ng/mL). RESULTS: At 
      baseline, 42.2% (n = 35) of participants in the NC group and 40.0% (n = 30) of 
      those in the CM group had a cannabis positive urine test. An overall intervention 
      by time interaction was detected for a cannabis negative urine test 
      (χ(2) = 13.40, p = 0.001). Compared to the NC group, the CM group had 3.92 (95% 
      CI:1.23-12.46) times higher odds of having a cannabis negative urine test during 
      the intervention period and 5.13 (95% CI:1.57-16.76) times higher odds of having 
      a negative cannabis test at the end of intervention period. CONCLUSION: CM 
      addressing alcohol misuse may be an effective strategy for decreasing cannabis 
      use among AI/AN adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
      Identifier: NCT02174315.

TI  - CANreduce 2.0 Adherence-Focused Guidance for Internet Self-Help Among Cannabis 
      Users: Three-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e27463
LID - 10.2196/27463 [doi]
LID - e27463
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite increasing demand for treatment among cannabis users in many 
      countries, most users are not in treatment. Internet-based self-help offers an 
      alternative for those hesitant to seek face-to-face therapy, though low 
      effectiveness and adherence issues often arise. OBJECTIVE: Through 
      adherence-focused guidance enhancement, we aimed to increase adherence to and the 
      effectiveness of internet-based self-help among cannabis users. METHODS: From 
      July 2016 to May 2019, cannabis users (n=775; male: 406/575, 70.6%, female: 
      169/575, 29.4%; age: mean 28.3 years) not in treatment were recruited from the 
      general population and were randomly assigned to (1) an adherence-focused 
      guidance enhancement internet-based self-help intervention with social presence, 
      (2) a similar intervention with an impersonal service team, and (3) access to 
      internet as usual. Controls who were placed on a waiting list for the full 
      intervention after 3 months underwent an assessment and had access to internet as 
      usual. The primary outcome measurement was cannabis-use days over the preceding 
      30 days. Secondary outcomes included cannabis-dependence severity, changes in 
      common mental disorder symptoms, and intervention adherence. Differences between 
      the study arms in primary and secondary continuous outcome variables at baseline, 
      posttreatment, and follow-up were tested using pooled linear models. RESULTS: All 
      groups exhibited reduced cannabis-use days after 3 months (social presence: -8.2 
      days; service team: -9.8 days; internet as usual: -4.2 days). The participants in 
      the service team group (P=.01, d=.60) reported significantly fewer cannabis-use 
      days than those in the internet as usual group; the reduction of cannabis use in 
      the social presence group was not significant (P=.07, d=.40). There was no 
      significant difference between the 2 intervention groups regarding cannabis-use 
      reduction. The service team group also exhibited superior improvements in 
      cannabis-use disorder, cannabis-dependence severity, and general anxiety symptoms 
      after 3 months to those in the internet as usual group. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      adherence-focused guidance enhancement internet-based self-help intervention with 
      an impersonal service team significantly reduced cannabis use, cannabis-use 
      disorder, dependence severity, and general anxiety symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Combined pharmacotherapy and evidence-based psychosocial Cannabis treatment for 
      youth and selection of cannabis-using friends.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Theoretical models of behavior change argue that youth should 
      decrease their time with cannabis-using friends and increase their time with 
      non-using friends during treatment. Informed by behavior-change models of 
      recovery and socialization and selection peer-influence models, the current study 
      examined whether combining evidence-based psychosocial treatment with adjunctive 
      pharmacotherapy helps youth decrease their affiliations with cannabis-using 
      friends and increase their affiliations with non-using friends during cannabis 
      misuse treatment. METHODS: Youth ages 15-24 years (51 % male), participated in a 
      double-blind randomized clinical trial that tested the effects of motivational 
      enhancement and cognitive behavioral therapy (MET-CBT) plus topiramate (N = 39) 
      or placebo (N = 26) on cannabis craving and use. Ecological momentary assessment 
      data, collected via smartphones throughout the six-week intervention, assessed 
      youths' time with cannabis-using and non-using friends, cannabis use, and craving 
      in daily life. Multiple group multilevel structural equation modeling tested 
      study hypotheses. RESULTS: Across the topiramate (48 % completion rate) and 
      placebo (77 % completion rate) conditions, greater time spent with cannabis-using 
      friends promoted greater next day cannabis use and craving (socialization 
      effect). In turn, cannabis craving, but not use, promoted continued selection of 
      cannabis-using friends. This indirect effect was only supported in the placebo 
      condition due to the selection piece of this cycle not being significant for 
      youth who received topiramate. Neither cannabis craving nor use were associated 
      with time with non-using friends the next day. CONCLUSIONS: MET-CBT and 
      adjunctive topiramate pharmacotherapy interrupted youth selection processes. This 
      finding suggests that changing peer affiliations could be one mechanism by which 
      treatments can work.

      adverse outcomes. Characterizing adolescent substance misusers, however, is 
      difficult due to the wide range of risk and protective factors linked to 
      substance use. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of the 
      Individual, Family, School, Peer, and Social Environment on alcohol (lifetime and 
      risky), tobacco (risky only), and cannabis use (lifetime and riskiness). METHOD: 
      Data were analyzed from a national sample of 5,680 adolescents, capturing 
      substance use behavior alongside risk and protective factors across Individual, 
      Family, School, Peer and Social domains. We applied a sophisticated machine 
      learning classifier to develop models of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis initiation 
      and misuse. RESULTS: We found highly accurate (area under curve of 
      receiver-operator-characteristic for out-of-sample performance was > .88) and 
      replicable (over multiple iterations and in comparison with permuted outcomes) 
      dissociable psychosocial profiles of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use. Alongside 
      common predictors (peer relations and externalizing behavior), dissociable risk 
      and resilience factors were observed. Adolescent profiles of alcohol use were 
      distinguished by the contribution of multiple domains. In contrast, tobacco use 
      was characterized by a small number of individual variables, including female 
      gender and poor perceived academic position. Cannabis use was differentiated by 
      the distinct contribution of Individual risk factors, in particular male gender 
      and feelings of anger. Differential associations were also evident, with the 
      strength and direction of association differing substantially across substances. 
      CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the relationship between the environment 
      and substance use is more complex than previously thought.

PG  - 142-146
LID - 10.1111/eip.12542 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The primary aim of this study was to examine the effect of recent tobacco, 
      alcohol and cannabis use on treatment outcomes among participants experiencing 
      first episode psychosis (FEP). METHODS: Secondary data analyses were conducted on 
      404 participants enrolled in the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia 
      Episode-Early Treatment Program (RAISE-ETP) study. RAISE-ETP investigated the 
      effectiveness of a coordinated specialty care (CSC) intervention for FEP in 
      community mental health agencies in the United States. Generalized estimating 
      equations were used to examine whether recent tobacco smoking, alcohol, and 
      cannabis use at baseline were associated with illness severity, number of 
      antipsychotic pills missed, psychiatric symptoms and quality of life during the 
      24-month treatment period, after controlling for duration of untreated psychosis 
      and treatment group. RESULTS: At baseline, roughly 50% (n = 209) of participants 
      reported recent tobacco, 28% (n = 113) alcohol and 24% (n = 95) cannabis use. 
      Tobacco smokers had higher levels of illness severity (β = .24; P < .005), a 
      higher number of missed pills (β = 2.89; P < .05), higher psychiatric symptoms 
      and lower quality of life during treatment relative to non-smokers. Alcohol users 
      had a higher number of missed pills (β = 3.16; P < .05) during treatment and 
      cannabis users had higher levels of illness severity (β = .18; P < .05) and 
      positive symptoms (β = 1.56; P < .05) relative to non-users. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use are common in youth seeking treatment for FEP. 
      Tobacco smoking was associated with more negative clinical outcomes. These 
      findings have implications for including interventions targeting these areas of 
      substance use within current CSC models.

AB  - PURPOSE: Cannabis use is increasing among emerging adults (ages 18-25), 
      necessitating the need for prevention interventions. Using a novel platform - 
      social media - we developed an 8-week motivational interviewing and 
      cognitive-behavioral intervention targeting cannabis use among emerging adults. 
      Herein, we report on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in a 
      pilot trial. PROCEDURES: For NCT04187989 we recruited N = 149 emerging adults who 
      used cannabis (at least 3 times/week for the past month) using social media 
      advertising. Their mean age was 21.0 years (SD = 2.2); 55.7% were female. Most 
      were White (70.5%; 20.1% Black/African American, 9.4% Other races), with 20.1% 
      identifying as Hispanic/Latinx. Participants were randomized to the 8-week 
      intervention or an 8-week attention-placebo control condition, both delivered in 
      secret Facebook groups by electronic health coaches (e-coaches). Follow-up 
      assessments occurred at 3- and 6-months. RESULTS: The intervention was 
      well-received and follow-up rates were high; fidelity was good. Intervention 
      participants rated e-coaches significantly higher in terms of helpfulness, 
      warmth, etc., compared to control participants. Intervention participants were 
      more likely to engage with and recommend the group. In terms of percentage 
      reductions in cannabis outcomes, the intervention group evidenced absolute 
      reductions over time in several measures of cannabis consumption across 
      modalities. In an adjusted model, reductions in vaping days in the intervention 
      group, relative to attention-control, reached statistical significance (p = .020, 
      D =.40). CONCLUSIONS: This social media intervention for emerging adults' 
      cannabis use was feasible and acceptable in the target population warranting 
      future testing in a fully powered trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Justice-involved adolescents are at high risk for sexually 
      transmitted infections; one primary reason is co-occurring substance use. This 
      study investigates the additive benefit of including alcohol and cannabis use 
      content in a theory-based sexual risk reduction intervention, delivered using 
      group-based motivational enhancement therapy. STUDY DESIGN: This study had a 
      cluster randomized design, with randomization of single-sex clusters to 1 of 3 
      interventions. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Participants were male and female 
      justice-involved adolescents (N=460) residing in youth detention facilities. Data 
      were collected from 2010 to 2014; analyses were completed in 2018-2019. 
      INTERVENTION: Adolescents were randomized to 1 of 3 motivational enhancement 
      therapy interventions: sexual risk reduction intervention, sexual risk reduction 
      intervention with alcohol content, or sexual risk reduction intervention with 
      alcohol and cannabis content. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 
      risky sexual behavior (aggregation of condom use and frequency of intercourse), 
      measured every 3 months for 1 year. Secondary outcomes were theoretical 
      mechanisms on which the intervention was based (condom use attitudes, 
      self-efficacy, peer norms, and behavioral intentions), collected at baseline and 
      post-test. RESULTS: Risky sexual behavior significantly decreased from baseline 
      to 3-month follow-up (t=10.59, p<0.001) and this decrease was maintained 1 year 
      later (t=9.04, p<0.001). Intervention was associated with improved values on all 
      theoretical mechanisms. Although all outcomes improved over time, changes did not 
      differ by intervention condition (p>0.29 for all). Comparisons to a historical, 
      information-only, sexual risk reduction control arm conducted with a similar 
      juvenile justice sample confirm the effectiveness of all 3 motivational 
      enhancement therapy-based interventions. CONCLUSIONS: All 3 interventions were 
      associated with decreased sexual risk up to 1 year later, suggesting that the 
      intervention modality (motivational enhancement therapy) may resonate with this 
      population beyond the specific substance use content. This single-session 
      manualized intervention can be readily disseminated to juvenile justice settings.

      emerging adults.

LID - 10.1037/abn0000342 [doi]
AB  - In light of expanding legalization of cannabis and swelling debate about the 
      potential risks, particularly for younger users, understanding acute cannabis 
      effects among adolescents and emerging adults is more important than ever. 
      Contemporary models of addiction development identify subjective drug responses 
      as central to the developmental unfolding of drug use disorders. Despite this, 
      surprisingly little is known about cannabis's acute subjective effects in human 
      youths. This research utilized ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in the 
      natural environment to identify the typical situational context of cannabis use 
      among 85 frequent cannabis users, ages 15-24 years (M = 19.8, SD = 2.0; 48.2% 
      female). Study aims were to (a) characterize momentary changes in several 
      subjective states (i.e., stimulation, sedation, tension, craving, and high) when 
      not using, just before cannabis use, and after use, and (b) evaluate whether 
      cannabis responses varied with cannabis use disorder (CUD) severity or across the 
      transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood in a correlational manner. Use 
      of cannabis produced measurable reductions in craving and tension, as well as 
      increases in stimulation, sedation, and "high." Participants with more CUD 
      symptoms reported greater relief of craving and increased stimulatory response 
      and high following use. In contrast, emerging adults reported diminished 
      stimulatory response and high following use, relative to adolescents. Results 
      highlight the utility of EMA for characterizing cannabis response as this 
      behavior unfolds in daily life, during a key developmental timeframe in the 
      pathogenesis of cannabis-use pathology. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Efficacy of a Web-Based Tailored Intervention to Reduce Cannabis Use Among Young 
      People Attending Adult Education Centers in Quebec.
PG  - 853-860
LID - 10.1089/tmj.2017.0144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis use is common among young adults. Web-based interventions 
      are an increasingly popular way to reach this population. The aim of this study 
      was to evaluate the efficacy of a Web-based tailored intervention, developed on 
      theoretical and empirical grounds, to reduce cannabis use among young people by 
      promoting a more positive intention to abstain. METHODS: An experimental design 
      was employed to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention in reducing cannabis 
      use (primary outcome) by bolstering intention (secondary outcome) to abstain from 
      use. Participants were randomly assigned either to an experimental group that 
      received the Web-based tailored intervention or to a control group that did not. 
      RESULTS: Of 588 young adults (18-24 years of age) recruited, 295 were randomly 
      assigned to the experimental group and 293 to the control group. At baseline, 343 
      reported using cannabis at least once in the past year. An intention-to-treat 
      analysis showed that, at postintervention, a higher proportion of participants in 
      the experimental group had reduced their cannabis use compared with the control 
      group [10.8% vs. 5.1%, χ(2)(2) = 9.89, p = 0.007]. A mixed model for repeated 
      measures revealed a statistically significant difference in terms of change in 
      intention to abstain from cannabis use in the coming month [Group × Time 
      interaction, F(1,474) = 8.03, p = 0.005]: intention increased for the 
      experimental group (5.07 ± 2.07 to 5.45 ± 1.88; p < 0.001), but stayed stable for 
      the control group (5.32 ± 2.03 to 5.36 ± 1.99; p = 0.779). CONCLUSION: This study 
      shows that the intervention can be efficacious in reducing cannabis use among 
      young people attending adult education centers.

TI  - Clinical and cost-effectiveness of contingency management for cannabis use in 
      early psychosis: the CIRCLE randomised clinical trial.
PG  - 161
LID - 10.1186/s12916-019-1395-5 [doi]
LID - 161
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance amongst people 
      with psychosis. Continued cannabis use following the onset of psychosis is 
      associated with poorer functional and clinical outcomes. However, finding 
      effective ways of intervening has been very challenging. We examined the clinical 
      and cost-effectiveness of adjunctive contingency management (CM), which involves 
      incentives for abstinence from cannabis use, in people with a recent diagnosis of 
      psychosis. METHODS: CIRCLE was a pragmatic multi-centre randomised controlled 
      trial. Participants were recruited via Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) 
      services across the Midlands and South East of England. They had had at least one 
      episode of clinically diagnosed psychosis (affective or non-affective); were aged 
      18 to 36; reported cannabis use in at least 12 out of the previous 24 weeks; and 
      were not currently receiving treatment for cannabis misuse, or subject to a legal 
      requirement for cannabis testing. Participants were randomised via a secure 
      web-based service 1:1 to either an experimental arm, involving 12 weeks of CM 
      plus a six-session psychoeducation package, or a control arm receiving the 
      psychoeducation package only. The total potential voucher reward in the CM 
      intervention was £240. The primary outcome was time to acute psychiatric care, 
      operationalised as admission to an acute mental health service (including 
      community alternatives to admission). Primary outcome data were collected from 
      patient records at 18 months post-consent by assessors masked to allocation. The 
      trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN33576045. RESULTS: 
      Five hundred fifty-one participants were recruited between June 2012 and April 
      2016. Primary outcome data were obtained for 272 (98%) in the CM (experimental) 
      group and 259 (95%) in the control group. There was no statistically significant 
      difference in time to acute psychiatric care (the primary outcome) (HR 1.03, 95% 
      CI 0.76, 1.40) between groups. By 18 months, 90 (33%) of participants in the CM 
      group, and 85 (30%) of the control groups had been admitted at least once to an 
      acute psychiatric service. Amongst those who had experienced an acute psychiatric 
      admission, the median time to admission was 196 days (IQR 82, 364) in the CM 
      group and 245 days (IQR 99, 382) in the control group. Cost-effectiveness 
      analyses suggest that there is an 81% likelihood that the intervention was 
      cost-effective, mainly resulting from higher mean inpatient costs for the control 
      group compared with the CM group; however, the cost difference between groups was 
      not statistically significant. There were 58 adverse events, 27 in the CM group 
      and 31 in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that CM 
      is not an effective intervention for improving the time to acute psychiatric 
      admission or reducing cannabis use in psychosis, at least at the level of voucher 
      reward offered.

TI  - Individualized assessment and treatment program (IATP) for cannabis use disorder: 
      Randomized controlled trial with and without contingency management.
PG  - 40-51
LID - 10.1037/adb0000491 [doi]
AB  - This study tested a new approach to the treatment of cannabis use disorder (CUD). 
      CUD is difficult to treat, and achieving abstinence is particularly difficult. 
      The individualized assessment and treatment program (IATP) was intended to 
      address this problem by providing a highly individualized approach to the 
      training of coping skills most relevant for each individual. To do this, an 
      experience sampling procedure was used prior to treatment to record patients' 
      marijuana use behavior and associated thoughts, feelings, coping behaviors, and 
      situations. This information was used by therapists to plan treatment that would 
      address the specific strengths and weaknesses of each patient in drug-use 
      situations. The present study tested IATP against a conventional combined 
      motivational enhancement cognitive-behavioral treatment (MET-CBT), with or 
      without the addition of contingency management (CM) for abstinence. The patients 
      were 198 men and women randomly assigned to 1 of 4 nine-session treatment 
      conditions: MET-CBT, MET-CBT-CM, IATP, or IATP-CM. Patients were assessed out to 
      14 months. Planned contrasts indicated that the IATP conditions yielded greater 
      levels of abstinence than did the MET-CBT conditions. The addition of CM did not 
      bolster the performance of IATP but did do so for MET-CBT. As expected, IATP lead 
      to greater use of coping skills than did the MET-CBT conditions. However, coping 
      skills use was not a significant predictor of outcome when other variables were 
      in the same analyses. Self-efficacy was a robust predictor and mediator of 
      outcome. We suggest that the IATP may act by enhancing self-efficacy. (PsycINFO

TI  - Distress tolerance and cannabis craving: The impact of laboratory-induced 
      distress.
PG  - 38-44
LID - 10.1037/pha0000231 [doi]
AB  - Low levels of distress tolerance have been identified as an important 
      vulnerability factor for negative cannabis outcomes. The current study is the 
      first known experimental manipulation of state distress to test whether distress 
      tolerance interacts with state distress to predict the urge to use cannabis. 
      Current cannabis users (N = 126; 88.9% with cannabis use disorder; 54.0% 
      non-Hispanic Caucasian) were randomly assigned to a distress task condition or 
      neutral (reading) task condition. Participants in the 2 conditions did not differ 
      on distress tolerance, negative affect (NA), or craving at baseline. The distress 
      tolerance × condition interaction significantly predicted task NA, such that low 
      (but not high) distress tolerance was related to greater state NA throughout the 
      task. The distress tolerance × condition interaction significantly predicted 
      cannabis craving during the task, such that the distress condition was related to 
      greater cannabis craving at lower (but not higher) levels of distress tolerance. 
      In the distress condition, those who endorsed coping motives during the task 
      reported lower distress tolerance. Together these findings suggest that 
      individuals with lower distress tolerance experienced greater NA during a 
      laboratory-induced distress and reported greater cannabis craving when NA was 
      greatest during the task. This experimental study adds to a growing, but limited, 
      literature implicating lower levels of distress tolerance to the maintenance and 
      relapse of cannabis use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights

TI  - Stages of Change Model has Limited Value in Explaining the Change in Use of 
      Cannabis among Adolescent Participants in an Efficacious Motivational 
      Interviewing Intervention.
PG  - 363-372
LID - 10.1080/02791072.2017.1325030 [doi]
AB  - Previously, a Dutch randomized controlled trial evaluating an intervention aimed 
      at changing adolescents' cannabis use, called Moti-4, has shown its efficacy. A 
      secondary analysis of the Moti-4 data investigated the process of change 
      specified by the Stage of Change (SOC) model in cannabis use during the trial. 
      Seventy-one Moti-4 participants and 60 controls were recruited for the study with 
      a pre-test, post-test (T1), and six-month follow-up (T2). All participants showed 
      signs of problematic cannabis use. No contribution of the Moti-4 intervention to 
      a change in SOC between T1 and T2 was found. Although motivation for treatment 
      and motivation for change can be conceived as independent predictors of treatment 
      outcome, the SOC a person is in does not mediate the effect of the intervention 
      on change in cannabis use. However, a reduction in cannabis use was associated 
      with a positive change in "action willingness," in line with the SOC model. In 
      contrast to model expectations, a higher score on "contemplation" is associated 
      with a higher cannabis consumption. Results highlight both the limitations and 
      usefulness of the SOC model. Future interventions may focus more on the stage of 
      "action willingness," as well as on perceived social norms.

TI  - Momentary coping and marijuana use in treated adults: Exploring mechanisms of 
      treatment.
PG  - 264-276
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000633 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to test the hypothesis that an Individualized 
      Assessment and Treatment Program (IATP) for cannabis use disorder (CUD) that 
      utilized experience sampling (ES) data to individualize treatment would be more 
      effective at eliciting adaptive coping responses in high-risk situations than a 
      more conventional cognitive-behavioral treatment. It was further expected that 
      increases in momentary adaptive coping, positive affect, and self-efficacy 
      expectancies would mediate the effects of treatment on momentary drug use in the 
      hours following a temptation-to-use episode. METHOD: The participants were 198 
      adults seeking treatment for CUD, randomized to receive either a conventional 
      motivational enhancement + cognitive-behavioral treatment (MET-CBT) with or 
      without contingency management (CM) or an IATP with or without CM. Treatment took 
      place over nine individual sessions, and follow-ups were conducted out to 14 
      months post-intake. ES data were recorded in all treatments at pretreatment, and 
      at various points during and after treatment. RESULTS: Analyses of ES data 
      indicated that the IATP conditions yielded greater increases in use of adaptive 
      coping skills during temptation episodes than did the MET-CBT conditions. 
      Mediation analyses supported the hypothesis that momentary use of coping skills 
      mediates the effects of IATP on use or non-use of marijuana in the hours 
      following a temptation episode. CONCLUSIONS: Use of an individualized coping 
      treatment approach results in lower use of marijuana in high-risk situations, and 
      actual utilization of adaptive coping appears to be a mechanism of that effect.

TI  - Substance Use Disorder Detection Rates Among Providers of General Medical 
      Inpatients.
PG  - 668-675
LID - 10.1007/s11606-020-06319-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of substance use disorders is higher among medical 
      inpatients than in the general population, placing inpatient providers in a prime 
      position to detect these patients and intervene. OBJECTIVE: To assess provider 
      detection rates of substance use disorders among medical inpatients and to 
      identify patient characteristics associated with detection. DESIGN: Data drawn 
      from a cluster randomized controlled trial that tested the effectiveness of three 
      distinct implementation strategies for providers to screen patients for substance 
      use disorders and deliver a brief intervention (Clinical Trials.gov : 
      NCT01825057). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1076 patients receiving care from 13 
      general medical inpatient units in a large teaching hospital participated in this 
      study. MAIN MEASURES: Data sources included patient self-reported questionnaires, 
      a diagnostic interview for substance use disorders, and patient medical records. 
      Provider detection was determined by diagnoses documented in medical records. KEY 
      RESULTS: Provider detection rates were highest for nicotine use disorder (72.2%) 
      and lowest for cannabis use disorder (26.4%). Detection of alcohol use disorder 
      was more likely among male compared to female patients (OR (95% CI) = 4.0 (1.9, 
      4.8)). When compared to White patients, alcohol (OR (95% CI) = 0.4 (0.2, 0.6)) 
      and opioid (OR (95% CI) = 0.2 (0.1, 0.7)) use disorders were less likely to be 
      detected among Black patients, while alcohol (OR (95% CI) = 0.3 (0.0, 2.0)) and 
      cocaine (OR (95% CI) = 0.3 (0.1, 0.9)) use disorders were less likely to be 
      detected among Hispanic patients. Providers were more likely to detect nicotine, 
      alcohol, opioid, and other drug use disorders among patients with higher 
      addiction severity (OR (95% CI) = 1.20 (1.08-1.34), 1.62 (1.48, 1.78), 1.46 
      (1.07, 1.98), 1.38 (1.00, 1.90), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate 
      patient characteristics, including gender, race, and addiction severity impact 
      rates of provider detection. Instituting formal screening for all substances may 
      increase provider detection and inform treatment decisions.

TI  - Nabilone pharmacotherapy for cannabis dependence: A randomized, controlled pilot 
      study.
PG  - 795-801
LID - 10.1111/ajad.12622 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We assessed the safety, tolerability, and preliminary 
      efficacy of nabilone, a cannabinoid agonist, to treat cannabis dependence. 
      METHODS: Eighteen adults with DSM-IV cannabis dependence were randomized to 
      receive either 2 mg/day of nabilone (n = 10) or placebo (n = 8) for 10 weeks in 
      addition to medication management. Twelve participants, six in each group, 
      completed treatment. The safety and tolerability of nabilone was assessed at each 
      visit. Any side effects from nabilone or the placebo were documented. Cannabis 
      use outcomes were assessed via self-report of days of use and twice-weekly urine 
      cannabinoid tests; secondary outcomes included cannabis craving and anxiety. 
      RESULTS: We assessed safety and tolerability at each study visit. A total of 
      eight adverse events, all mild or moderate, were reported in two participants in 
      the nabilone group, and six events were reported in four participants in the 
      placebo group during study treatment. A total of eight adverse events were 
      reported in two participants in the nabilone group and six events were reported 
      in four participants in the placebo group during study treatment. All reported 
      adverse events were rated mild-to-moderate. There were no side effects deemed 
      serious enough to be classified as an FDA-defined serious adverse event. In 
      general, participants in both groups reported reduced cannabis use according to 
      self-report over the course of the study, although these reductions were not 
      statistically discernible. Moreover, there was no difference in cannabis use 
      between the nabilone group and the placebo group as measured by self-report. 
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Nabilone pharmacotherapy was safe and well-tolerated 
      in participants with cannabis dependence. Future studies might evaluate a higher 
      dose of nabilone to determine its effects on cannabis use outcomes in 
      participants with cannabis dependence. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: There remains a 
      clear need for additional pharmacotherapy trials for cannabis dependence, and 
      nabilone remains a candidate for such trials. (Am J Addict 2017;26:795-801).

AB  - This pilot study sought to test the feasibility of screening and delivering a 
      web-based intervention to reduce marijuana use and consequences among graduate 
      student presenting to a Student Health Center (SHC). Graduate students completed 
      a 9-item electronic health screening instrument during their visit to the SHC. 
      Those who reported monthly or greater marijuana use were eligible for 
      participation in the pilot trial. Forty-nine students completed baseline 
      assessments and were randomly assigned to an electronic screening and brief 
      intervention (eSBI) for marijuana (eCHECKUPTOGO-marijuana; [BI]) or a control 
      condition (CTL) that consisted of minimal general health information. 
      Participants completed measures of marijuana use frequency and negative 
      consequences at baseline, 3- and 6-months. Latent growth modeling was used to 
      provide effect size estimates for the influence of the intervention on 6-month 
      outcomes. Effect size estimates showed a small-to-medium effect of BI on 
      marijuana use frequency at 6-months; there was no evidence of the BI on 
      consequences. Results suggest that BI may hold promise as a method to reduce 
      marijuana use among graduate students who present to primary care settings. 
      Future research should test the efficacy of this approach in a full-scale 
      randomized controlled trial.

TI  - Reduced responsiveness of the reward system is associated with tolerance to 
      cannabis impairment in chronic users.

AB  - Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the world. However, because of 
      a changing legal landscape and rising interest in therapeutic utility, there is 
      an increasing trend in (long-term) use and possibly cannabis impairment. 
      Importantly, a growing body of evidence suggests that regular cannabis users 
      develop tolerance to the impairing, as well as the rewarding, effects of the 
      drug. However, the neuroadaptations that may underlie cannabis tolerance remain 
      unclear. Therefore, this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over 
      study assessed the acute influence of cannabis on the brain and behavioral 
      outcomes in two distinct cannabis user groups. Twelve occasional and 12 chronic 
      cannabis users received acute doses of cannabis (300-μg/kg 
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and placebo and underwent ultrahigh field 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In 
      occasional users, cannabis induced significant neurometabolic alterations in 
      reward circuitry, namely, decrements in functional connectivity and increments in 
      striatal glutamate concentrations, which were associated with increases in 
      subjective high and decreases in performance on a sustained attention task. Such 
      changes were absent in chronic users. The finding that cannabis altered circuitry 
      and distorted behavior in occasional, but not chronic users, suggests reduced 
      responsiveness of the reward circuitry to cannabis intoxication in chronic users. 
      Taken together, the results suggest a pharmacodynamic mechanism for the 
      development of tolerance to cannabis impairment, of which is important to 
      understand in the context of the long-term therapeutic use of cannabis-based 
      medications, as well as in the context of public health and safety of cannabis 
      use when performing day-to-day operations.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The rapidly growing legal cannabis market includes new and highly 
      potent products, the effects of which, to our knowledge, have not previously been 
      examined in biobehavioral research studies because of federal restrictions on 
      cannabis research. OBJECTIVE: To use federally compatible, observational methods 
      to study high-∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) legal market forms of cannabis. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study with a between-groups 
      design that was conducted in a community and university setting, cannabis flower 
      users and concentrate users were randomly assigned to higher- vs lower-THC 
      products within user groups. Participants completed a baseline and an 
      experimental mobile laboratory assessment that included 3 points: before, 
      immediately after, and 1 hour after ad libitum legal market flower and 
      concentrate use. Of the 133 individuals enrolled and assessed, 55 regular flower 
      cannabis users (41.4%) and 66 regular concentrate cannabis users (49.6%) complied 
      with the study's cannabis use instructions and had complete data across primary 
      outcomes. EXPOSURES: Flower users were randomly assigned to use either 16% or 24% 
      THC flower and concentrate users were randomly assigned to use either 70% or 90% 
      THC concentrate that they purchased from a dispensary. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Primary outcome measures included plasma cannabinoids, subjective drug 
      intoxication, and neurobehavioral tasks testing attention, memory, inhibitory 
      control, and balance. RESULTS: A total of 121 participants completed the study 
      for analysis: 55 flower users (mean [SD] age, 28.8 [8.1] years; 25 women [46%]) 
      and 66 concentrate users (mean [SD] age, 28.3 [10.4] years; 30 women [45%]). 
      Concentrate users compared with flower users exhibited higher plasma THC levels 
      and 11-hydroxyΔ9-THC (THC's active metabolite) across all points. After ad 
      libitum cannabis administration, mean plasma THC levels were 0.32 (SE = 0.43) 
      μg/mL in concentrate users (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 3.18) 
      and 0.14 (SE = 0.16) μg/mL in flower users. Most neurobehavioral measures were 
      not altered by short-term cannabis consumption. However, delayed verbal memory 
      (F1,203 = 32.31; P < .001) and balance function (F1,203 = 18.88; P < .001) were 
      impaired after use. Differing outcomes for the type of product (flower vs 
      concentrate) or potency within products were not observed. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: This study provides information about the association of 
      pharmacological and neurobehavioral outcomes with legal market cannabis. 
      Short-term use of concentrates was associated with higher levels of THC exposure. 
      Across forms of cannabis and potencies, users' domains of verbal memory and 
      proprioception-focused postural stability were primarily associated with THC 
      administration.

AB  - Approximately 1.8 million young adults aged 18 to 25 had a Cannabis Use Disorder 
      (CUD) in the past year. Unfortunately, engaging young adults in treatment is very 
      challenging. Creative approaches to treat cannabis disorders such as integrating 
      mobile technology with evidence-based treatments are warranted. In light of these 
      challenges, we developed a text message-delivered version of Peer Network 
      Counseling (PNC-txt), which is a substance use intervention that focuses on peer 
      relations. PNC-txt engages participants in 16 automated, personalized text 
      interactions over 4weeks. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the 
      efficacy of PNC-txt against a waitlist control group with 30 treatment seeking 
      young adults (ages 18-25) who met DSM-5 criteria for CUD. Self-report and urine 
      analyses were used to test outcomes at the three-month follow-up. The PNC-txt 
      group significantly reduced their cannabis use related problems as well as 
      cannabis cravings, compared to the control group. PNC-txt participants also had a 
      significantly greater percentage with urines negative for cannabis metabolites 
      compared to controls. Moderation analysis showed that CUD severity level 
      moderated treatment, suggesting that PNC-txt is more effective for participants 
      with medium and high levels of CUD severity. All effect sizes ranged from medium 
      to large. Results from this pilot trial are promising and warrant further 
      research on PNC-txt for addressing cannabis use disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few effective treatment options exist for cannabis-using youth. This 
      pilot study aimed to test Approach-Avoidance Training to reduce cannabis use with 
      non-treatment-seeking adolescents. METHODS: Eighty cannabis-using 
      non-treatment-seeking adolescents (average age 19) were recruited from San Diego, 
      California and Charleston, South Carolina, and randomized to complete either six 
      sessions of Cannabis Approach-Avoidance Task Training (CAAT-training) designed to 
      reduce automatic approach biases for cannabis cues or CAAT-sham training. Change 
      in two primary outcome variables was examined: 1) cannabis approach bias and 2) 
      percent cannabis use days over study enrollment. Change in percent alcohol use 
      days over study enrollment was explored as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: A mixed 
      models repeated measures analysis confirmed the group by time interaction effect 
      for approach bias failed to reach statistical significance (p = .06). Significant 
      group by time interaction effects (ps < 0.05) predicted percent days of cannabis 
      and alcohol use over study enrollment. Participants randomized to the avoid 
      cannabis condition (CAAT-training) reported 7% fewer days of cannabis use 
      compared to 0% change for sham; unexpectedly, those in the avoid cannabis 
      condition reported 10% percent more alcohol use days compared to 3% more for 
      sham. CONCLUSIONS: Computerized cognitive bias modification paradigms may have 
      utility in reducing adolescent cannabis use. Future work should consider 
      developing a paradigm that addresses both cannabis and alcohol, as well as 
      alternative computerized approaches for coping with addictive behavior in 
      conjunction with bias modification.

TI  - Blunted stress reactivity in chronic cannabis users.
PG  - 2299-2309
LID - 10.1007/s00213-017-4648-z [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: One of the most commonly cited reasons for chronic cannabis use is to 
      cope with stress. Consistent with this, cannabis users have shown reduced 
      emotional arousal and dampened stress reactivity in response to negative imagery. 
      OBJECTIVES: To our knowledge, the present study represents the first to examine 
      the effects of an acute stress manipulation on subjective stress and salivary 
      cortisol in chronic cannabis users compared to non-users. METHODS: Forty cannabis 
      users and 42 non-users were randomly assigned to complete either the stress or no 
      stress conditions of the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST). The stress 
      condition of the MAST manipulates both physiological (placing hand in ice bath) 
      and psychosocial stress (performing math under conditions of social evaluation). 
      Participants gave baseline subjective stress ratings before, during, and after 
      the stress manipulation. Cortisol was measured from saliva samples obtained 
      before and after the stress manipulation. Further, cannabis cravings and symptoms 
      of withdrawal were measured. RESULTS: Subjective stress ratings and cortisol 
      levels were significantly higher in non-users in the stress condition relative to 
      non-users in the no stress condition. In contrast, cannabis users demonstrated 
      blunted stress reactivity; specifically, they showed no increase in cortisol and 
      a significantly smaller increase in subjective stress ratings. The stress 
      manipulation had no impact on cannabis users' self-reported cravings or 
      withdrawal symptoms. CONCLUSION: Chronic cannabis use is associated with blunted 
      stress reactivity. Future research is needed to determine whether this helps to 
      confer resiliency or vulnerability to stress-related psychopathology as well as 
      the mechanisms underlying this effect.

TI  - Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol increases striatal glutamate levels in healthy 
      individuals: implications for psychosis.
PG  - 3231-3240
LID - 10.1038/s41380-019-0374-8 [doi]
AB  - The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the association between cannabis use 
      and acute or long-lasting psychosis are not completely understood. While some 
      evidence suggests altered striatal dopamine may underlie the association, direct 
      evidence that cannabis use affects either acute or chronic striatal dopamine is 
      inconclusive. In contrast, pre-clinical research suggests that cannabis may 
      affect dopamine via modulation of glutamate signaling. A double-blind, 
      randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design was used to investigate whether 
      altered striatal glutamate, as measured using proton magnetic resonance 
      spectroscopy, underlies the acute psychotomimetic effects of intravenously 
      administered delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC; 1.19 mg/2 ml), the key 
      psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, in a set of 16 healthy participants (7 
      males) with modest previous cannabis exposure. Compared to placebo, acute 
      administration of Δ9-THC significantly increased Glutamate (Glu) + Glutamine 
      (Gln) metabolites (Glx) in the left caudate head (P = 0.027). Furthermore, 
      compared to individuals who were not sensitive to the psychotomimetic effects of 
      Δ9-THC, individuals who developed transient psychotic-like symptoms (~70% of the 
      sample) had significantly lower baseline Glx (placebo; P 7= 0.023) and a 
      2.27-times higher increase following Δ9-THC administration. Lower baseline Glx 
      values (r = -0.55; P = 0.026) and higher previous cannabis exposure (r = 0.52; 
      P = 0.040) were associated with a higher Δ9-THC-induced Glx increase. These 
      results suggest that an increase in striatal glutamate levels may underlie acute 
      cannabis-induced psychosis while lower baseline levels may be a marker of greater 
      sensitivity to its acute psychotomimetic effects and may have important public 
      health implications.

TI  - Responsiveness to mHealth Intervention for Cannabis Use in Young Adults Predicts 
      Improved Outcomes.
PG  - 630-635
LID - 10.1007/s11121-022-01333-z [doi]
AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have proliferated rapidly in part because 
      of their advantages in reducing consumer and provider burden, but less attention 
      has been paid to participant responsiveness to mHealth programs and how this may 
      affect outcomes. This study adds to that literature by examining whether 
      participant responsiveness to a text messaging-delivered intervention was 
      predictive of treatment outcomes over baseline levels of the outcome. We analyzed 
      data from a pilot-randomized controlled trial of a text messaging-intervention to 
      treat young adults with cannabis use disorder (treatment arm, N = 47), examining 
      three indicators of responsiveness (two behavioral: treatment completion and 
      booster message participation; and one subjective: perceived helpfulness of 
      treatment) on abstinence from cannabis use and use-related problems measured at 
      3-month follow-up. With the exception of completion, the indicators were 
      positively correlated with each other. Each of the indicators was predictive of 
      better treatment outcomes above and beyond baseline risk. Treatment completion 
      and booster participation-measured via technical data captured during 
      intervention administration-appeared to be stronger predictors of improved 
      outcomes than self-reported perceived helpfulness. Results suggest that 
      behavioral and subjective responsiveness measures appear to be valid indicators 
      of treatment response to mHealth interventions for substance use. Responsiveness 
      measured via technical data captured during intervention administration may be a 
      stronger and more efficient strategy for monitoring continued engagement. We 
      discuss implications of these findings for deploying mHealth interventions at 
      scale and monitoring responsiveness.

TI  - Neurosteroid Levels in Patients With Bipolar Disorder and a History of Cannabis 
      Use Disorders.
PG  - 684-688
LID - 10.1097/JCP.0000000000000793 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: In animal models, levels of the neurosteroid pregnenolone 
      increase after tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) administration and pregnenolone appears 
      to attenuate the brain effects of THC. Given these interactions between 
      pregnenolone and THC, we evaluated baseline neurosteroid levels in participants 
      with a history of a cannabis use disorders (CUDs). METHODS/PROCEDURES: Bipolar 
      depressed participants were enrolled in a randomized placebo-controlled clinical 
      trial to evaluate the efficacy of add-on pregnenolone for depression and before 
      receiving pregnenolone or placebo. Baseline serum levels of neurosteroids 
      (pregnenolone, allopregnanolone, pregnanolone, and androsterone) were analyzed in 
      53 participants with highly sensitive and specific gas chromatography/mass 
      spectrometry. Current, active substance use disorders, or a positive baseline 
      urine drug screen, were exclusionary. Participants were classified by past 
      cannabis abuse or dependence diagnosis using the structured clinical interview 
      for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Data 
      were analyzed by independent t tests for separate neurosteroids. 
      FINDINGS/RESULTS: Participants with a history of CUD had higher serum 
      pregnanolone, lower allopregnanolone, a higher pregnanolone to allopregnanolone 
      ratio, and a lower pregnenolone to pregnanolone ratio compared with those without 
      a history of cannabis use. Similar findings were not observed based on a history 
      of other substance use disorders with the exception of lower allopregnanolone in 
      those with opioid use disorders. Notably, the majority of those with an opioid 
      use disorder also had a CUD (75%). IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      potentially suggest either enduring changes in neurosteroids in people with past 
      CUDs or represent a vulnerability marker for a CUD.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of motivational interviewing for alcohol and cannabis 
      use within a predominantly Hispanic adolescent sample.
PG  - 287-299
LID - 10.1037/pha0000445 [doi]
AB  - Hispanic youth represent one of the fastest-growing minority groups. Yet, we know 
      little about Hispanic adolescents' response to empirically-supported 
      interventions for adolescent addiction, including motivational interviewing (MI). 
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared MI to an active educational 
      treatment for adolescent alcohol and cannabis use (alcohol and cannabis 
      education; ACE). Adolescents who regularly use substances (N = 448; n = 347 
      Hispanic; n = 101 non-Hispanic white; ages 13-18) were randomized to two 1-hr 
      individual sessions of MI or ACE. We examined 6-month outcomes and mechanisms of 
      change across Hispanic and non-Hispanic white youth. Treatment response was 
      comparable across ethnicities (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic white youth). 
      Additionally, adolescents in the MI condition showed greater reductions in 
      alcohol use compared to those in ACE, with support for motivation and 
      self-efficacy as mechanisms of treatment response. Direct effects of MI on 
      cannabis use were not observed; however, a significant indirect effect of 
      motivation was observed for reductions in cannabis use. Data support the efficacy 
      of MI in reducing adolescent alcohol use, through the vehicle of enhanced 
      motivation and self-efficacy. While consistent treatment response was observed 
      for adolescent alcohol use across ethnicities (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic white), 
      further exploration into potential underexplored mechanisms of Hispanic 
      adolescents' treatment response is requisite to strengthening prevention and 
      intervention programming for Hispanic adolescents' cannabis use. (PsycInfo

TI  - Working memory training and high magnitude incentives for youth cannabis use: A 
      SMART pilot trial.
PG  - 31-39
LID - 10.1037/adb0000480 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this sequential multiple-assignment randomization treatment pilot 
      study was to examine if (a) adding working memory training to contingency 
      management (CM) for youth with cannabis use disorder (CUD) and (b) switching 
      nonresponding youth to higher magnitude CM incentives boosts outcomes. In Phase 
      1, youth with CUD (n = 59, M age = 16, male = 71%) attending an intensive 
      outpatient program were randomly assigned to 14 weeks of CM only or CM plus 
      working memory training (WMT). In Week 4, a Phase 2 treatment was assigned. Those 
      with negative urine drug tests (responders) continued in their Phase 1 treatment. 
      Those who were drug positive (nonresponders) were randomly assigned to remain in 
      their Phase 1 treatment or to higher magnitude CM. Zero-inflated negative 
      binomial models comparing those assigned to CM versus CM + WMT indicated no 
      differences in the likelihood of having ≥ 1 week of continuous abstinence or 
      longer abstinence duration. Those assigned to WMT showed greater but 
      nonsignificant improvements in working memory (n = 35; β = .69, p = .06). Working 
      memory improvements were associated with achieving any abstinence (odds ratio = 
      3.50, 95% CI [1.01, 12.10], p = .05). Phase 2 randomization to higher magnitude 
      CM did not boost outcomes. Overall results suggest that WMT appears promising, 
      but the sample size was small, attrition was high, and replication is important. 
      Alternative strategies should continue to be explored to improve outcomes for 
      adolescent substance use disorders, such as different approaches for 
      nonresponders, tailoring to other baseline or response characteristics, or more 
      robust first-line interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all

AB  - Multidimensional family therapy (MDFT) is an established treatment program for 
      youth displaying multiproblem behavior. We examined whether MDFT decreased 
      criminal offending among cannabis abusing adolescents, as compared with 
      individual psychotherapy (IP). In a Western European randomized controlled trial 
      comparing MDFT with IP, a sample of 169 adolescents with a cannabis disorder 
      completed self-reports on criminal offending. Half indicated they had committed 
      one or more criminal offenses in the 90 days before the baseline assessment. 
      Follow-up assessments were at 6 and 12 months after randomization. The proportion 
      of adolescents reporting nondelinquency increased during the study period, most 
      so in the MDFT condition. In addition, MDFT lowered the number of violent 
      offenses more than IP. This difference was not seen for property crimes. In 
      cannabis abusing adolescents, MDFT is an effective treatment to prevent and 
      reduce criminal offending. MDFT outperforms IP for violent crimes.

TI  - A Mobile Phone-Based Life-Skills Training Program for Substance Use Prevention 
      Among Adolescents: Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e26951
LID - 10.2196/26951 [doi]
LID - e26951
AB  - BACKGROUND: Life skills are abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that 
      enable individuals to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of 
      everyday life. Life-skills training programs conducted within the school 
      curriculum are effective in preventing the onset and escalation of substance use 
      among adolescents. However, their dissemination is impeded due to their large 
      resource requirements. Life-skills training provided via mobile phones may 
      provide a more economic and scalable approach. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study 
      was to test the appropriateness (ie, acceptance, use, and evaluation) and 
      short-term efficacy of a mobile phone-based life-skills training program to 
      prevent substance use among adolescents within a controlled trial. METHODS: The 
      study design was a two-arm, parallel-group, cluster-randomized controlled trial 
      with assessments at baseline and follow-up assessments after 6 and 18 months. 
      This report includes outcomes measured up to the 6-month follow-up. The efficacy 
      of the intervention was tested in comparison to an assessment-only control group. 
      The automated intervention program SmartCoach included online feedback and 
      individually tailored text messages provided over 22 weeks. The contents were 
      based on social cognitive theory and addressed self-management skills, social 
      skills, and substance use resistance skills. Linear mixed models and generalized 
      linear mixed models, as well as logistic or linear regressions, were used to 
      investigate changes between baseline and 6-month follow-up in the following 
      outcomes: 30-day prevalence rates of problem drinking, tobacco use, and cannabis 
      use as well as quantity of alcohol use, quantity of cigarettes smoked, cannabis 
      use days, perceived stress, well-being, and social skills. RESULTS: A total of 
      1759 students from 89 Swiss secondary and upper secondary school classes were 
      invited to participate in the study. Of these, 1473 (83.7%) students participated 
      in the study; the mean age was 15.4 years (SD 1.0) and 55.2% (813/1473) were 
      female. Follow-up assessments at 6 months were completed by 1233 (83.7%) study 
      participants. On average, program participants responded to half (23.6 out of 50) 
      of the prompted activities. Program evaluations underlined its appropriateness 
      for the target group of secondary school students, with the majority rating the 
      program as helpful and individually tailored. The results concerning the initial 
      effectiveness of this program based on 6-month follow-up data are promising, with 
      three of nine outcomes of the intention-to-treat analyses showing beneficial 
      developments of statistical significance (ie, quantity of alcohol use, quantity 
      of tobacco use, and perceived stress; P<.05) and another three outcomes (ie, 
      problem drinking prevalence, cannabis use days, and social skills) showing 
      beneficial developments of borderline significance (P<.10). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results showed good acceptance of this intervention program that could be easily 
      and economically implemented in school classes. Initial results on program 
      efficacy indicate that it might be effective in both preventing or reducing 
      substance use and fostering life skills; however, data from the final 18-month 
      follow-up assessments will be more conclusive. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN

AB  - AIM: A number of important health disparities associated with place of residence 
      have been reported in the literature. The Remoteness Index (RI) was developed to 
      account for community size, population density, and proximity to larger 
      population centres. This exploratory analysis uses the RI to examine community 
      level associations related to cannabis use. DESIGN: This secondary analysis uses 
      data collected as part of a randomized controlled trial of a brief cannabis 
      intervention. Participants' place of residence was matched to a corresponding 
      value on the RI. Univariate regressions of RI and cannabis related outcomes were 
      modeled with age and gender as moderating variables. Three outcomes were analyzed 
      separately: 1) total number of days of cannabis use in the past 30 days; 2) risk 
      of experiencing cannabis related problems; and 3) number of self-reported 
      consequences related to cannabis. FINDINGS: Participants living in more remote 
      areas were significantly more likely to drive within an hour of using cannabis, 
      but also reported fewer consequences and less risky cannabis use. Although the 
      overall regression models tested in the moderation analyses were significant, 
      there were no interaction effects between RI and age or gender. CONCLUSION: While 
      this analysis did not find significant conditional effects of age or gender on 
      the relationship between cannabis use and place of residence, further research is 
      needed to investigate other factors which may contribute to health disparities 
      related to substance use between individuals living in different geographic 
      regions.

TI  - Universal cannabis outcomes from the Climate and Preventure (CAP) study: a 
      cluster randomised controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Climate and Preventure (CAP) study was the first trial to assess 
      and demonstrate the effectiveness of a combined universal and selective approach 
      for preventing alcohol use and related harms among adolescents. The current paper 
      reports universal effects from the CAP study on cannabis-related outcomes over 
      three years. METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with 
      2190 students from twenty-six Australian high schools (mean age: 13.3 yrs., SD 
      0.48). Participants were randomised to one of four conditions; universal 
      prevention for all students (Climate); selective prevention for high-risk 
      students (Preventure); combined universal and selective prevention (Climate and 
      Preventure; CAP); or health education as usual (Control). Participants were 
      assessed at baseline, post intervention (6-9 months post baseline), and at 12-, 
      24- and 36-months, on measures of cannabis use, knowledge and related harms. This 
      paper compares cannabis-related knowledge, harms and cannabis use in the Control, 
      Climate and CAP groups as specified in the protocol, using multilevel mixed 
      linear models to assess outcomes. RESULTS: Compared to Control, the Climate and 
      CAP groups showed significantly greater increases in cannabis-related knowledge 
      initially (p <  0.001), and had higher knowledge at the 6, 12 and 24-month 
      follow-ups. There was no significant difference between the Climate and CAP 
      groups. While no differences were detected between Control and the CAP and 
      Climate groups on cannabis use or cannabis-related harms, the prevalence of these 
      outcomes was lower than anticipated, possibly limiting power to detect 
      intervention effects. Additional Bayesian analyses exploring confidence in 
      accepting the null hypothesis showed there was insufficient evidence to conclude 
      that the interventions had no effect, or to conclude that they had a meaningfully 
      large effect. CONCLUSIONS: Both the universal Climate and the combined CAP 
      programs were effective in increasing cannabis-related knowledge for up to 
      2 years. The evidence was inconclusive regarding whether the interventions 
      reduced cannabis use and cannabis-related harms. A longer-term follow-up will 
      ascertain whether the interventions become effective in reducing these outcomes 
      as adolescents transition into early adulthood. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial 
      was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry 
      (ACTRN12612000026820) on the 6th of January 2012,

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is a prevalent and impairing condition, 
      and established psychosocial treatments convey limited efficacy. In light of 
      recent findings supporting the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for CUD in 
      adolescents, the objective of this trial was to evaluate its efficacy in adults. 
      METHODS: In a 12-week double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, 
      treatment-seeking adults ages 18-50 with CUD (N=302), enrolled across six 
      National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network-affiliated clinical sites, 
      were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a 12-week course of NAC 1200mg (n=153) or 
      placebo (n=149) twice daily. All participants received contingency management 
      (CM) and medical management. The primary efficacy measure was the odds of 
      negative urine cannabinoid tests during treatment, compared between NAC and 
      placebo participants. RESULTS: There was not statistically significant evidence 
      that the NAC and placebo groups differed in cannabis abstinence (odds ratio=1.00, 
      95% confidence interval 0.63-1.59, p=0.984). Overall, 22.3% of urine cannabinoid 
      tests in the NAC group were negative, compared with 22.4% in the placebo group. 
      Many participants were medication non-adherent; exploratory analysis within 
      medication-adherent subgroups revealed no significant differential abstinence 
      outcomes by treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with prior findings in 
      adolescents, there is no evidence that NAC 1200mg twice daily plus CM is 
      differentially efficacious for CUD in adults when compared to placebo plus CM. 
      This discrepant finding between adolescents and adults with CUD may have been 
      influenced by differences in development, cannabis use profiles, responses to 
      embedded behavioral treatment, medication adherence, and other factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantifying cannabis use is complex due to a lack of a standardized 
      packaging system that contains specified amounts of constituents. A laboratory 
      procedure has been developed for estimating physical quantity of cannabis use by 
      utilizing a surrogate substance to represent cannabis, and weighing the amount of 
      the surrogate to determine typical use in grams. METHOD: This secondary analysis 
      utilized data from a multi-site, randomized, controlled pharmacological trial for 
      adult cannabis use disorder (N=300), sponsored by the National Drug Abuse 
      Treatment Clinical Trials Network, to test the incremental validity of this 
      procedure. In conjunction with the Timeline Followback, this physical scale-based 
      procedure was used to determine whether average grams per cannabis administration 
      predicted urine cannabinoid levels (11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and 
      problems due to use, after accounting for self-reported number of days used (in 
      the past 30 days) and number of administrations per day in a 12-week clinical 
      trial for cannabis use disorder. RESULTS: Likelihood ratio tests suggest that 
      model fit was significantly improved when grams per administration and relevant 
      interactions were included in the model predicting urine cannabinoid level 
      (X(2)=98.3; p<0.05) and in the model predicting problems due to cannabis use 
      (X(2)=6.4; p<0.05), relative to a model that contained only simpler measures of 
      quantity and frequency. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides support for the use of a 
      scale-based method for quantifying cannabis use in grams. This methodology may be 
      useful when precise quantification is necessary (e.g., measuring reduction in use 
      in a clinical trial).

TI  - Effect of screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment for unhealthy 
      alcohol and other drug use in mental health treatment settings: a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 159-169

AB  - AIMS: To test the efficacy of a brief intervention to reduce alcohol or drug use 
      and to promote use of addiction services among patients seeking mental health 
      treatment. DESIGN AND SETTING: A multi-centre, longitudinal, two-group randomized 
      controlled trial with randomization within each of two mental health treatment 
      systems located in Ventura County and Los Angeles County in California, USA. 
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 718 patients (49.2% female) aged 18 and older with a 
      mental health diagnosis and either a heavy drinking day or any use of cannabis or 
      stimulants in the past 90 days. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: A motivation-based 
      brief intervention with personalized feedback (screening, brief intervention and 
      referral to treatment (SBIRT) condition) (n = 354) or a health education session 
      (control condition) (n = 364). MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes included frequency 
      of heavy drinking days, days of cannabis use and days of stimulant use at the 
      primary end-point 3 months post-baseline. Secondary outcomes included frequency 
      and abstinence from substance use out to a 12-month follow-up and the use of 
      addiction treatment services. FINDINGS: Participants in the SBIRT condition had 
      fewer heavy drinking days [odds ratio (OR) = 0.53; 95% credible interval 
      (CrI) = 0.48-0.6] and fewer days of stimulant use (OR = 0.58; 95% 
      CrI = 0.50-0.66) at the 3-month follow-up compared with participants in the 
      health education condition. Participants in the SBIRT condition did not 
      comparatively reduce days of cannabis use at the 3-month follow-up (OR = 0.93; 
      95% CrI = 0.85-1.01). Secondary outcomes indicated sustained effects of SBIRT on 
      reducing the frequency of heavy drinking days and days of stimulant use. No 
      effects were observed on abstinence rates or use of addiction treatment services. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Screening and brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and drug use 
      in mental health treatment settings were effective at reducing the frequency of 
      heavy drinking and stimulant use.

      for adults with frequent cannabis use: a randomized controlled trial of CANreduce

AB  - BACKGROUND: Though Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) and 
      mindfulness-based interventions (generally delivered in-situ) appear effective 
      for people with substance use disorders, IMIs incorporating mindfulness are 
      largely missing, including those targeting frequent cannabis use. METHODS: This 
      paper details the protocol for a three-arm randomized controlled trial comparing 
      a mindfulness-based self-help IMI (arm 1) and cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT)-based self-help IMI (arm 2) versus being on a waiting list (arm 3) in their 
      effectiveness reducing cannabis use in frequent cannabis users. Predictors of 
      retention, adherence and treatment outcomes will be identified and similarities 
      between the two active intervention arms explored. Both active interventions last 
      six weeks and consist of eight modules designed to reduce cannabis use and common 
      mental health symptoms. With a targeted sample size of n = 210 per treatment arm, 
      data will be collected at baseline immediately before program use is initiated; 
      at six weeks, immediately after program completion; and at three and six months 
      post baseline assessment to assess the retention of any gains achieved during 
      treatment. The primary outcome will be number of days of cannabis use over the 
      preceding 30 days. Secondary outcomes will include further measures of cannabis 
      use and use of other substances, changes in mental health symptoms and 
      mindfulness, client satisfaction, intervention retention and adherence, and 
      adverse effects. Data analysis will follow ITT principles and primarily employ 
      (generalized) linear mixed models. DISCUSSION: This RCT will provide important 
      insights into the effectiveness of an IMI integrating mindfulness to reduce 
      cannabis use in frequent cannabis users. TRIAL REGISTRATION: International

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cannabis use disorders (CUDs) are highly comorbid in patients with 
      schizophrenia and associated with poor outcome. Clozapine has been put forward as 
      the first choice antipsychotic in this patient group. However, little is known 
      about the mechanisms underlying the assumed superiority of clozapine. METHODS: A 
      total of 38 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia (30 with and 8 without a DSM-IV 
      CUD) and 20 healthy comparison subjects were included between April 2009 and June 
      2012. Patients were randomized to antipsychotic treatment with clozapine or 
      risperidone. At baseline and after 4weeks of medication, brain response to 
      cannabis-related, positive and neutral images was measured using functional MRI. 
      Neural correlates of cue reactivity were assessed in the following regions of 
      interest: amygdala, ventral striatum, insula, thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex and 
      anterior cingulate cortex. Subjective craving was assessed using self-report 
      questionnaires (OCDUS and MCQ). RESULTS: At baseline, patients with a comorbid 
      CUD showed higher subjective craving and greater activation in response to 
      cannabis-related images compared to patients without a CUD and healthy controls 
      in most regions of interest. Clozapine treated patients reported a greater 
      reduction in craving (F(1,28)=6.0, p=0.04) and showed a larger decrease in 
      amygdala activation during cannabis-related images compared to risperidone 
      treated patients (T=3.94, pFWE=0.006). In addition, significant correlations were 
      found between subjective craving and thalamus and insula activation during 
      cannabis-related images. CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence that 
      clozapine is superior to risperidone in decreasing subjective craving and cue 
      reactivity for cannabis-related images probably due to a differential effect on 
      dopaminergic neurotransmission. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 'Nederlands trial register'

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is a growing public health concern, and 
      is highly comorbid with negative affective conditions such as anxiety and 
      depression. Late adolescence and early adulthood represents a time of rapid 
      emotion regulation development, as well as the onset of anxiety, mood, and 
      substance use disorders, especially CUD. Maladaptive cognitive, behavioral, and 
      emotional responding to one's own negative affect (in an effort to eliminate it) 
      is associated with substance use, and represents a novel treatment target to 
      improve outcomes of treatment for substance misuse. METHOD: After development of 
      a manual for a novel intervention, Affect Management Treatment (AMT) for CUD, a 
      pilot randomized clinical trial was conducted in 18-25 year-old participants with 
      CUD to evaluate the impact of this approach on negative affect, constructs (e.g., 
      distress intolerance) representing maladaptive reactivity to negative affect, and 
      cannabis use. Participants (N = 52) received either 12 sessions of standard 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for CUD or 12 sessions of AMT and were 
      assessed on measures of negative affect, reactivity to negative affect, cannabis 
      use, and cannabis use problems at baseline, throughout treatment, post-treatment, 
      and 6-mo follow-up. RESULTS: AMT outperformed CBT in reducing negative affect and 
      reactivity to negative affect, and it had a significant impact on cannabis use 
      and cannabis use problems. There were no statistically significant between-group 
      differences on cannabis outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: AMT offers a novel, successful 
      approach to the treatment of CUD.

TI  - Nurse home visiting and prenatal substance use in a socioeconomically 
      disadvantaged population in British Columbia: analysis of prenatal secondary 
      outcomes in an ongoing randomized controlled trial.
PG  - E667-E675
LID - 10.9778/cmajo.20200063 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) involves public health nurses 
      providing frequent home visits from early pregnancy until children reach age 2 
      years, focusing on first-time parents experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. 
      Our aim was to evaluate NFP's effectiveness in improving child and maternal 
      health. METHODS: We conducted an analysis of prenatal secondary outcomes in an 
      ongoing randomized controlled trial in British Columbia; the data used in this 
      analysis were collected from January 2014 to May 2017. Participants were pregnant 
      girls and women aged 14-24 years who were preparing to parent for the first time 
      and experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. They were randomly allocated 1:1 to 
      the intervention (NFP plus existing services) or control group (existing 
      services). Prespecified prenatal secondary outcome indicators were changes in use 
      of nicotine cigarettes and alcohol use by 34-36-weeks' gestation. We also report 
      on prespecified exploratory cannabis and street drug use measures. We used 
      mixed-effect models for longitudinal and clustered data to estimate intervention 
      effects. Analyses were by intention to treat. RESULTS: The median gestational age 
      at baseline for the 739 participants (368 participants in the intervention group, 
      371 in the comparison group) was 20 weeks, 6 days. By 34-36 weeks' gestation, NFP 
      significantly reduced cigarette counts (over the past 2 d) (difference in changes 
      [DIC] of count -1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] -6.4 to -1.3) in those who 
      smoked. NFP also significantly reduced rates of prenatal cannabis use (DIC -6.4, 
      95% CI -17.0 to -1.7), but not rates of street drug or "any" substance use. While 
      we observed decreased rates of cigarette and alcohol use in both groups (DIC of 
      proportions -2.8, 95% CI -15.3 to 0.6; DIC -0.5, 95% CI -8.7 to 1.8, 
      respectively), these changes were not statistically significant. INTERPRETATION: 
      We found no evidence that NFP was effective in reducing rates of prenatal 
      cigarette and alcohol use; however, it led to reduced prenatal cannabis use, and 
      in smokers it led to modest reductions in cigarette use. NFP may therefore hold 
      promise for reducing some types of prenatal substance use in disadvantaged 
      populations. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT01672060.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sex differences in cannabis use disorder (CUD) and its treatment have 
      been identified. Women report more severe withdrawal and have shown worse 
      treatment outcomes. Ovarian hormones are implicated in these differences and 
      research suggests that exogenous progesterone may be an effective 
      pharmacotherapy. METHODS: The current randomized, placebo-controlled, feasibility 
      trial tested a novel multimodal methodology for administering exogenous 
      progesterone during acute cannabis withdrawal. Eight heavy cannabis using women 
      received micronized progesterone (200 mg bid) (n = 3) or matching placebo (n = 5) 
      during the early follicular phase of their menstrual cycle over a 5-day study 
      period while abstaining from cannabis. Laboratory visits (days 1 and 5) included 
      biological and self-report assessments, while home-based procedures (days 2-4) 
      included ambulatory assessments, video data capture and tele-drug testing, and 
      biological assessments. Primary outcomes were medication adherence and salivary 
      hormone levels, and the exploratory outcome was cannabis withdrawal severity. 
      RESULTS: Medication adherence rates were high as assessed via self-report 
      (100.0%) and video data capture (98.0%). Salivary progesterone levels differed 
      between groups over time (p < 0.027) and the progesterone group achieved levels 
      within the normal range during the luteal phase in healthy adults. All tele-drug 
      tests were negative confirming cannabis abstinence and there was an indication 
      (p = 0.07) of reduced cannabis craving among participants receiving progesterone. 
      CONCLUSION: More effective and sex-based treatments for cannabis use disorder are 
      needed. The current study provides a novel multimodal methodology with low 
      participant burden for investigating new medications for cannabis withdrawal. 
      Clinical trials of progesterone for cannabis withdrawal may be warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is a common condition with few 
      treatments. Several studies in other substance use disorders have found that 
      applying repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) decreases cue-elicited craving and possibly decreases 
      use. To date, there have been no studies attempting to use rTMS in CUD. 
      OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine if rTMS could be feasibly 
      delivered to a group of non-treatment seeking CUD participants. Secondarily, the 
      study aimed to estimate the effect of rTMS on craving. METHODS: In a 
      double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover design, a single session of active or 
      sham rTMS (Left DLPFC, 10 Hz, 110% rMT, 4000 pulses) was delivered during a 
      validated cannabis cue paradigm. Participants crossed over to complete the other 
      condition one week later. The feasibility and tolerability were measured by the 
      rate of retention, and the percentage of participants able to tolerate full dose 
      rTMS, respectively. Craving was measured using the Marijuana Craving 
      Questionnaire (MCQ). RESULTS: Eighteen non-treatment seeking CUD participants 
      were recruited from the community; 16 (three women) completed the trial (89% 
      retained for the three study visits). All of the treatment completers tolerated 
      rTMS at full dose without adverse effects. There was not a significant reduction 
      in the total MCQ when participants received active rTMS as compared to sham rTMS. 
      CONCLUSION: rTMS can be safely and feasibly delivered to CUD participants, and 
      treatment is well tolerated. A single session of rTMS applied to the DLPFC may 
      not reduce cue-elicited craving in heavy cannabis users.

      laboratory study.

AB  - As perspectives on cannabis continue to shift, understanding the physiological 
      and behavioral effects of cannabis use is of paramount importance. Previous data 
      suggest that cannabis use influences food intake, appetite, and metabolism, yet 
      human research in this regard remains scant. The present study investigated the 
      effects of cannabis administration, via different routes, on peripheral 
      concentrations of appetitive and metabolic hormones in a sample of cannabis 
      users. This was a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
      Twenty participants underwent four experimental sessions during which oral 
      cannabis, smoked cannabis, vaporized cannabis, or placebo was administered. 
      Active compounds contained 6.9 ± 0.95% (~50.6 mg) ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). 
      Repeated blood samples were obtained, and the following endocrine markers were 
      measured: total ghrelin, acyl-ghrelin, leptin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), 
      and insulin. Results showed a significant drug main effect (p = 0.001), as well 
      as a significant drug × time-point interaction effect (p = 0.01) on insulin. The 
      spike in blood insulin concentrations observed under the placebo condition 
      (probably due to the intake of brownie) was blunted by cannabis administration. A 
      significant drug main effect (p = 0.001), as well as a trend-level 
      drug × time-point interaction effect (p = 0.08) was also detected for GLP-1, 
      suggesting that GLP-1 concentrations were lower under cannabis, compared to the 
      placebo condition. Finally, a significant drug main effect (p = 0.01) was found 
      for total ghrelin, suggesting that total ghrelin concentrations during the oral 
      cannabis session were higher than the smoked and vaporized cannabis sessions. In 
      conclusion, cannabis administration in this study modulated blood concentrations 
      of some appetitive and metabolic hormones, chiefly insulin, in cannabis users. 
      Understanding the mechanisms underpinning these effects may provide additional 
      information on the cross-talk between cannabinoids and physiological pathways 
      related to appetite and metabolism.

AB  - PURPOSE: There are few efficacious prevention interventions for emerging adults 
      (ages 18-25) drug use and concomitant risks (e.g., sexual risk behaviors). We 
      developed and evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of an Emergency 
      Department (ED)-initiated brief intervention (BI) combined with booster messaging 
      as a clinician-extender primarily focusing on drug use, with a secondary focus on 
      condomless sex. We examined descriptive outcomes of alcohol, drug use, and 
      condomless sex. PROCEDURES: We recruited N = 63 emerging adults who used drugs 
      (primarily cannabis) from an ED (72.4 % participation rate). Their mean age was 
      21.7 years (SD = 2.3); 67 % were female and 52.4 % were Black/African American. 
      Participants randomized to the intervention (N = 31) received a BI and 28 days of 
      tailored booster messaging (based on drug use motives) daily, and the control 
      condition received a community resource brochure. A post-test occurred at 1-month 
      with a follow-up at 2-months. RESULTS: The intervention was well-received (83.9 % 
      allocated completed the BI) with 79 % overall liking the BI and 71 % finding it 
      helpful to discuss substances. Mean ratings of booster messages were >4.0 
      (5-point scale); 77 % liked the daily messages and 91 % found them helpful. 
      Descriptively, the intervention group evidenced absolute reductions over time on 
      alcohol outcomes, cannabis use, and condomless sex. CONCLUSIONS: This BI with 
      booster messages was feasible and acceptable in the target population of emerging 
      adults who use drugs (i.e., mostly cannabis). This intervention model, initiated 
      during a healthcare visit and accompanied by a clinician-extender, should be 
      tested in a future fully-powered trial.

TI  - Influence of tiagabine maintenance on cannabis effects and related behaviors in 
      daily cannabis users.
PG  - 310-319
LID - 10.1037/pha0000180 [doi]
AB  - No medications are approved for cannabis use disorder (CUD). Gamma-aminobutyric 
      acid (GABA) reuptake is modulated by cannabinoid (CB) receptor agonists, and 
      there are shared effects between CB agonists and the GABA reuptake inhibitor 
      tiagabine. This overlapping neuropharmacology suggested that tiagabine might be 
      useful for CUD. The study determined the ability of tiagabine maintenance to 
      reduce cannabis self-administration using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, 
      counterbalanced, within-subjects design. Nontreatment-seeking daily cannabis 
      users (N = 12; 3 female, 9 male) completed two 12-day outpatient maintenance 
      phases (0 or 12 mg of tiagabine/day). Each phase consisted of a safety session, 7 
      maintenance days, and 4 experimental sessions. During experimental sessions, 
      maintenance continued and participants completed two 2-day blocks of sampling and 
      self-administration sessions to determine the reinforcing effects of smoked 
      cannabis (0% and 5.9% Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol). Naturalistic cannabis use, the 
      subjective, performance and physiological response to cannabis, as well as side 
      effects, sleep quality, craving, other self-reported substance use, and observer 
      ratings were also measured. Cannabis functioned as a reinforcer and produced 
      prototypical effects (e.g., increased heart rate and ratings of "high"), but 
      tiagabine generally did not impact the effects of cannabis, or alter naturalistic 
      use. Furthermore, tiagabine produced small, but significant, increases on 2 
      subscales of a Marijuana Craving Questionnaire, and reductions in both the amount 
      of time slept in the past 24 hr and ratings of positive mood upon awakening. 
      These human laboratory results from a sample of nontreatment-seeking cannabis 
      users do not support the potential efficacy of 12 mg of tiagabine as a 
      stand-alone pharmacotherapy for CUD. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - On-line personalized feedback intervention for negative affect and cannabis: A 
      pilot randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 143-149
LID - 10.1037/pha0000304 [doi]
AB  - Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance and many users report 
      difficulty quitting. Situations involving stress and negative affect are the most 
      difficult in which to abstain during quit/reduction attempts. Further, cannabis 
      users with elevated social anxiety experience greater cannabis-related impairment 
      than individuals with more normative levels of social anxiety. Yet, although most 
      persons with cannabis-related problems are interested in quitting and endorse 
      negative emotional symptoms, the vast majority do not seek in-person treatment. 
      Thus, the current study tested the utility of an online personalized feedback 
      intervention (PFI) that integrates feedback regarding cannabis with strategies to 
      manage negative affect (PFI-NAC). Current (past month) cannabis using 
      undergraduates (who used cannabis weekly, on average) were randomly assigned to 
      the 1-session PFI-NAC (n = 37) or an assessment-only control (n = 26) and 
      completed a 2-week follow-up assessment. After controlling for baseline negative 
      affect and cannabis use frequency, social anxiety interacted with condition to 
      predict follow-up cannabis use frequency. Specifically, among those with moderate 
      or high levels of social anxiety, those in PFI-NAC reported less use at follow up 
      than controls; this was not the case among those with lower social anxiety. 
      Results of this pilot study indicate a 1-session intervention that teaches 
      simultaneously teaching skills to manage negative affect and cannabis may benefit 
      some cannabis users with moderate to high social anxiety. Future work with larger 
      samples and a wider range of cannabis users, with longer follow-up assessments, 
      are important next steps. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights

TI  - A web-based episodic specificity and future thinking session modulates delay 
      discounting in cannabis users.
PG  - 532-540
LID - 10.1037/adb0000557 [doi]
AB  - Episodic future thinking (EFT), a brief intervention involving mental simulation 
      of positive future events, improves delay discounting (DD) in nicotine and 
      alcohol dependent individuals. This study is the first to assess effects of a 
      single-session, online episodic training (ET) on constructs that might impact 
      cannabis use and cannabis use disorder. A sample of 200 active cannabis users 
      recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk were randomized to an EFT group (n = 102) or 
      an episodic recent thinking control group (ERT; n = 98). A novel episodic 
      specificity induction (ES) was included to enhance quality of episodic thinking 
      for the ET group, and an ES attention control was provided to the ERT group 
      (control training group; CT). Quality and manipulation ratings of event 
      excitement, vividness, importance, and enjoyment of trainings were collected in 
      addition to DD tasks (gains and losses) and readiness to change cannabis use. The 
      ET group reported higher overall quality and manipulation ratings than did the CT 
      group (p < .001, d = 0.79). DD of gains was lower in the ET relative to those of 
      the CT group after controlling for relevant variables (p = .003, d = 0.48), 
      unlike DD of losses (p = .50, d = 0.11). The ET group showed larger pre/post 
      increases in readiness to change, but they were not statistically significant (p 
      = .069, d = 0.26). These effects, following a session of online ET, suggests that 
      ET may positively impact factors related to reduction in cannabis use. 
      Differential effects of EFT and ES components on DD and the development of ET as 
      an adjunctive mHealth intervention targeting reduction in cannabis use appears 
      warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

TI  - Cannabis Dampens the Effects of Music in Brain Regions Sensitive to Reward and 
      Emotion.
PG  - 21-32
LID - 10.1093/ijnp/pyx082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the current shift towards permissive cannabis policies, few 
      studies have investigated the pleasurable effects users seek. Here, we 
      investigate the effects of cannabis on listening to music, a rewarding activity 
      that frequently occurs in the context of recreational cannabis use. We 
      additionally tested how these effects are influenced by cannabidiol, which may 
      offset cannabis-related harms. METHODS: Across 3 sessions, 16 cannabis users 
      inhaled cannabis with cannabidiol, cannabis without cannabidiol, and placebo. We 
      compared their response to music relative to control excerpts of scrambled sound 
      during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging within regions identified in a 
      meta-analysis of music-evoked reward and emotion. All results were False 
      Discovery Rate corrected (P<.05). RESULTS: Compared with placebo, cannabis 
      without cannabidiol dampened response to music in bilateral auditory cortex 
      (right: P=.005, left: P=.008), right hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus (P=.025), 
      right amygdala (P=.025), and right ventral striatum (P=.033). Across all 
      sessions, the effects of music in this ventral striatal region correlated with 
      pleasure ratings (P=.002) and increased functional connectivity with auditory 
      cortex (right: P< .001, left: P< .001), supporting its involvement in music 
      reward. Functional connectivity between right ventral striatum and auditory 
      cortex was increased by cannabidiol (right: P=.003, left: P=.030), and cannabis 
      with cannabidiol did not differ from placebo on any functional Magnetic Resonance 
      Imaging measures. Both types of cannabis increased ratings of wanting to listen 
      to music (P<.002) and enhanced sound perception (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis 
      dampens the effects of music in brain regions sensitive to reward and emotion. 
      These effects were offset by a key cannabis constituent, cannabidol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic, idiopathic, 
      inflammatory, gastrointestinal disorders. The endocannabinoid system may have a 
      role in the pathogenesis of IBD. We aimed to assess whether cannabis treatment 
      influences endocannabinoids (eCBs) level and clinical symptoms of IBD patients. 
      METHODS: Blood samples and biopsies were taken from IBD patients treated by 
      either cannabis or placebo for 8 weeks. Immunohistochemistry for 
      N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-selective phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) and fatty 
      acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) expression was done on colon biopsies, and sample 
      levels of anandamide (AEA), eCB2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), arachidonic acid 
      (AA), palmitoylethanolamine (PEA), and oleoylethanolamine (OEA) were measured in 
      patient's sera before and after cannabis treatment. Caco-2 cells were cultured 
      with extracts of cannabis with/without tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and their 
      proteins extracted, and Western blotting for NAPE-PLD and FAAH expression was 
      done. RESULTS: Thirteen patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and nine patients with 
      ulcerative colitis (UC) were treated with cannabis. Seventeen patients with CD 
      and 10 with UC served as placebo groups. In all CD patients, the levels of eCBs 
      remained unaltered during the treatment period. In UC patients treated with 
      placebo, but not in those treated with cannabis, the levels of PEA, AEA, and AA 
      decreased significantly. The percent reduction in bowel movements was negatively 
      correlated with changes observed in the circulating AEA and OEA, whereas 
      improvement in quality of life was positively correlated with the levels of 2-AG. 
      In the biopsies from UC patients, FAAH levels increased over the study period. In 
      Caco-2 cells, both cannabis extracts increased NAPE-PLD levels but reduced FAAH 
      expression levels. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the notion that cannabis use 
      affects eCB "tone" in UC patients and may have beneficial effects on disease 
      symptoms in UC patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate prevalence and predictors of early depression response 
      (EDR) in adolescents with substance use and depression receiving 
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for substance use and to test the efficacy of 
      supplemental CBT targeting depression (CBT-D) for non-EDR adolescents in an 
      adaptive treatment approach. METHOD: At 2 sites, 95 youths (ages 14-21, mean 
      [SD] = 17.4 [1.8]) with alcohol or cannabis use and depressive symptoms received 
      up to 12 sessions of CBT for substance use over 14 weeks. Assessments were at 
      baseline and weeks 4, 9, and 14. The Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised 
      was the primary depression measure, with a reduction of 50% or more on this scale 
      at week 4 defining EDR. The primary substance use outcomes of alcohol use, heavy 
      alcohol use, and cannabis use frequency were assessed via interview report on the 
      Alcohol Consumption Questionnaire and the Drug Checklist. Urinalysis provided a 
      secondary measure of cannabis use. Non-EDR adolescents were randomly assigned to 
      supplemental CBT-D or enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU). RESULTS: Thirty-five 
      adolescents (37%; 95% CI, 27%-47%) demonstrated EDR. Fewer days of cannabis use 
      (odds ratio 0.977; 95% CI, 0.961-0.992) and absence of conduct disorder (odds 
      ratio 0.149; 95% CI, 0.031-0.716) predicted EDR. Frequency of drinking (F(1,82) = 
      11.09, η(2) = 0.119, p = .001), heavy drinking (F(1,82) = 19.91, η(2) = 0.195, 
      p < .0001), and cannabis use (F(1,220) = 35.01, η(2) = 0.137, p < .001) decreased 
      over time for EDR, CBT-D, and ETAU adolescents, with EDR adolescents evidencing 
      earlier lower cannabis use (F(2,220) = 4.16, η(2) = 0.036, p = .0169). Negative 
      (clean) urine screens increased over time (F(1,219) = 5.10, η(2) = 0.023, p = 
      .0249). Comparison of CBT-D and ETAU indicated that depression significantly 
      decreased over time in both groups (F(1,48) = 64.20, η(2) = 0.572, p < .001), 
      with no advantage for CBT-D. CONCLUSION: Approximately one-third of adolescents 
      with substance use and depression attain EDR during substance use treatment. Less 
      frequent cannabis use facilitates depression response. The relatively small 
      sample may have precluded identification of additional EDR predictors. CLINICAL

TI  - Sensory gating in tobacco-naïve cannabis users is unaffected by acute nicotine 
      administration.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Long-term cannabis use has been associated with the appearance of 
      psychotic symptoms and schizophrenia-like cognitive impairments; however these 
      studies may be confounded by concomitant use of tobacco by cannabis users. We 
      aimed to determine if previously observed cannabis-associated deficits in sensory 
      gating would be seen in cannabis users with no history of tobacco use, as 
      evidenced by changes in the P50, N100, and P200 event-related potentials. A 
      secondary objective of this study was to examine the effects of acute nicotine 
      administration on cannabis users with no tobacco use history. METHODS: Three 
      components (P50, N100, P200) of the mid-latency auditory-evoked response (MLAER) 
      were elicited by a paired-stimulus paradigm in 43 healthy, non-tobacco smoking 
      male volunteers between the ages of 18-30. Cannabis users (CU, n = 20) were 
      administered nicotine (6 mg) and placebo gum within a randomized, double-blind 
      design. Non-cannabis users (NU, n = 23) did not receive nicotine. RESULTS: 
      Between-group sensory gating effects were only observed for the N100, with CUs 
      exhibiting a smaller N100 to S(1) of the paired stimulus paradigm, in addition to 
      reduced dN100 (indicating poorer gating). Results revealed no significant sensory 
      gating differences with acute administration of nicotine compared to placebo 
      cannabis conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a relationship between 
      gating impairment and cannabis use; however, acute nicotine administration 
      nicotine does not appear to impact sensory gating function.

AB  - Assessment and personalised feedback are important components of brief 
      interventions (BIs) for cannabis use. A key outcome is to increase motivation to 
      change during this short interaction. The diversity of available assessments and 
      time burden scoring them pose a challenge for routine use in clinical practice. 
      An instant assessment and feedback (iAx) system was developed to administer 
      assessments informed by bioSocial Cognitive Theory, that were instantly scored 
      and benchmarked against clinical norms, to provide patient feedback and guide 
      treatment planning. This study evaluated the feasibility and additive 
      effectiveness of the iAx on motivation to change cannabis use, when compared to 
      treatment as usual (TAU), in a single-session BI. A randomised controlled trial 
      was conducted in a public hospital alcohol and drug outpatient clinic. 
      Eighty-seven cannabis users (M(age) = 26.41; 66% male) were assigned to the BI 
      utilising the iAx (iAx; n = 44) or to the standard BI (TAU; n = 43). Patients 
      completed pre- and post-BI assessments of motivation to change and a post-BI 
      measure of treatment satisfaction. Practitioners completed a feedback survey. 
      Patients receiving iAx reported a significantly greater increase in motivation to 
      change from pre- to post-BI compared to patients receiving TAU (d = 0.49, 
      p = .03). Treatment satisfaction was high across both conditions, with no 
      significant difference between groups (p = .57). Practitioners also reported a 
      high level of satisfaction with the iAx system. In summary, findings support the 
      feasibility and additive effectiveness of the iAx to enhance patient motivation 
      during cannabis BI.

TI  - Nicotine patch for cannabis withdrawal symptom relief: a randomized controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 1507-1519
LID - 10.1007/s00213-020-05476-1 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Given that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and nicotine have similar 
      effects on negative affect (NA), we hypothesized that a 7-mg nicotine patch (NP) 
      would reduce NA-related cannabis (CAN) withdrawal symptoms in cannabis-dependent 
      (CD) individuals who were not nicotine dependent. OBJECTIVE: We sought to 
      determine whether NP reduces NA across 15 days of CAN abstinence in two groups: 
      non-tobacco smokers (NTS) and light tobacco smokers (LTS). METHODS: CD 
      participants (N = 127; aged 18-35) who used CAN at least 5 times/week for the 
      past 12 + months were randomized to (1) NP or (2) a placebo patch (PP) and 
      received $300 for sustained biochemically verified CAN abstinence. Of those 
      randomly assigned, 52 of 63 NP, and 56 of 64 PP maintained biochemically verified 
      CAN abstinence and 51 NP and 50 PP participants complied with all aspects of the 
      study. Affect and other withdrawal symptoms were measured every 48 h across 
      15 days of CAN abstinence. RESULTS: After controlling for age, tobacco use, 
      baseline THC concentration, and baseline measurements of the dependent variable, 
      NP reduced NA symptoms across the 15-day treatment relative to PP. Differences in 
      NA and CAN withdrawal symptoms were not moderated by tobacco user status. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide the first evidence that NP may be able to 
      attenuate NA-related withdrawal symptoms in individuals with cannabis use 
      disorder who are not heavy users of tobacco or nicotine. CLINICAL TRIALS

TI  - Driving Performance and Cannabis Users' Perception of Safety: A Randomized 
      Clinical Trial.
PG  - 201-209
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.4037 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Expanding cannabis medicalization and legalization increases the 
      urgency to understand the factors associated with acute driving impairment. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine, in a large sample of regular cannabis users, the 
      magnitude and time course of driving impairment produced by smoked cannabis of 
      different Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, the effects of use history, and 
      concordance between perceived impairment and observed performance. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel 
      randomized clinical trial took place from February 2017 to June 2019 at the 
      Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research, University of California San Diego. 
      Cannabis users were recruited for this study, and analysis took place between 
      April 2020 and September 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Placebo or 5.9% or 13.4% THC 
      cannabis smoked ad libitum. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was 
      the Composite Drive Score (CDS), which comprised key driving simulator variables, 
      assessed prior to smoking and at multiple time points postsmoking. Additional 
      measures included self-perceptions of driving impairment and cannabis use 
      history. RESULTS: Of 191 cannabis users, 118 (61.8%) were male, the mean (SD) age 
      was 29.9 (8.3) years, and the mean (SD) days of use in the past month was 16.7 
      (9.8). Participants were randomized to the placebo group (63 [33.0%]), 5.9% THC 
      (66 [34.6%]), and 13.4% THC (62 [32.5%]). Compared with placebo, the THC group 
      significantly declined on the Composite Drive Score at 30 minutes (Cohen d = 0.59 
      [95% CI, 0.28-0.90]; P < .001) and 1 hour 30 minutes (Cohen d = 0.55 [95% CI, 
      0.24-0.86]; P < .001), with borderline differences at 3 hours 30 minutes (Cohen 
      d = 0.29 [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.60]; P = .07) and no differences at 4 hours 30 
      minutes (Cohen d = -0.03 [95% CI, -0.33 to 0.28]; P = .87). The Composite Drive 
      Score did not differ based on THC content (likelihood ratio χ24 = 3.83; P = .43) 
      or use intensity (quantity × frequency) in the past 6 months (likelihood ratio 
      χ24 = 1.41; P = .49), despite postsmoking blood THC concentrations being higher 
      in those with the highest use intensity. Although there was hesitancy to drive 
      immediately postsmoking, increasing numbers (81 [68.6%]) of participants reported 
      readiness to drive at 1 hour 30 minutes despite performance not improving from 
      initial postsmoking levels. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Smoking cannabis ad 
      libitum by regular users resulted in simulated driving decrements. However, when 
      experienced users control their own intake, driving impairment cannot be inferred 
      based on THC content of the cigarette, behavioral tolerance, or THC blood 
      concentrations. Participants' increasing willingness to drive at 1 hour 30 
      minutes may indicate a false sense of driving safety. Worse driving performance 
      is evident for several hours postsmoking in many users but appears to resolve by 
      4 hours 30 minutes in most individuals. Further research is needed on the impact 
      of individual biologic differences, cannabis use history, and administration 
      methods on driving performance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Examination of Correlates of OUD Outcomes in Young Adults: Secondary Analysis 
      From the XBOT Trial.
PG  - 433-444
LID - 10.1111/ajad.13176 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment outcomes are 
      poorer for young adults than older adults. Developmental differences are broadly 
      implicated, but particular vulnerability factor interactions are poorly 
      understood. This study sought to identify moderators of OUD relapse between age 
      groups. METHODS: This secondary analysis compared young adults (18-25) to older 
      adults (26+) from a comparative effectiveness trial ("XBOT") that randomized 
      (N = 570) participants to extended-release naltrexone or sublingual 
      buprenorphine-naloxone. We explored the relationship between 25 prespecified 
      patient baseline characteristics and relapse to regular opioid use by age group 
      and treatment condition, using logistic regression. RESULTS: Young adults 
      (n = 111) had higher rates of 24-week relapse than older adults (n = 459) (70.3% 
      vs 58.8%) and differed on a number of specific characteristics, including more 
      smokers, more intravenous opioid use, and more cannabis use. No significant 
      moderators predicted relapse, in either three-way or two-way interactions. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: No baseline factors were identified as 
      moderating the relationship between age group and opioid relapse, nor any 
      interactions between baseline characteristics, age group, and treatment condition 
      to predict opioid relapse. Poorer treatment outcomes for young adults are likely 
      associated with multiple developmental vulnerabilities rather than any single 
      predominant factor. Although not reaching significance, several characteristics 
      (using heroin, smoking tobacco, high levels of depression/anxiety, or treatment 
      because of family/friends) showed higher odds ratio point estimates for relapse 
      in young adults than older adults. This is the first study to explore moderators 
      of worse OUD treatment outcomes in young adults, highlighting the need to 
      identify predictor variables that could inform treatment enhancements. (Am J 
      Addict 2021;00:1-12).

TI  - The effect of daily aerobic cycling exercise on sleep quality during inpatient 
      cannabis withdrawal: A randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e13211
LID - 10.1111/jsr.13211 [doi]
AB  - Sleep disturbance is a common symptom encountered by cannabis-dependent 
      individuals abstaining from cannabis use. In the present study, we investigated 
      the effect of daily aerobic cycling exercise versus control stretching on sleep 
      quality during inpatient cannabis withdrawal in treatment-seeking dependent 
      cannabis users. The protocol incorporated three consecutive phases: a 4-Day 
      (4-Night) (at-home) 'Baseline' phase, a 6-Day (5-Night) 'Treatment' phase (within 
      a 7-Day inpatient hospital stay) and a 3-Day (4-Night) (at-home) 'Post-Treatment' 
      phase. Participants performed 35 min of monitored activity per day during the 
      Treatment phase. The intervention group (n = 19) cycled at ~60% aerobic capacity 
      (VO(2max) ), while the control group (n = 12) performed a stretching routine. 
      Objective sleep quality was measured nightly throughout the study using wrist 
      actigraphy ratings of subjective sleep quality were also recorded during the 
      Treatment phase. There were no group differences in sleep measures during the 
      Baseline phase (all p > .05). Objective sleep onset latency increased from the 
      Baseline to the Treatment phase in the control (stretching) group (p = .042). In 
      contrast, the Cycling group exhibited improvements in sleep duration (p = .008) 
      and sleep efficiency (p = .023) during the Treatment phase compared to the 
      Baseline phase. Cycling also increased sleep duration (p = .005), decreased 
      average wake bout (p = .040) and tended to increase sleep efficiency (p = .051) 
      compared to stretching during the Treatment phase. Subjective sleep quality 
      ratings did not differ between groups (p > .10). These preliminary findings 
      suggest that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise may attenuate the sleep 
      disturbances associated with cannabis withdrawal.

TI  - Δ(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) impairs visual working memory performance: a 
      randomized crossover trial.
PG  - 1807-1816

AB  - With the increasing prevalence of legal cannabis use and availability, there is 
      an urgent need to identify cognitive impairments related to its use. It is widely 
      believed that cannabis, or its main psychoactive component 
      Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), impairs working memory, i.e., the ability to 
      temporarily hold information in mind. However, our review of the literature 
      yielded surprisingly little empirical support for an effect of THC or cannabis on 
      working memory. We thus conducted a study with three main goals: (1) quantify the 
      effect of THC on visual working memory in a well-powered sample, (2) test the 
      potential role of cognitive effects (mind wandering and metacognition) in 
      disrupting working memory, and (3) demonstrate how insufficient sample size and 
      task duration reduce the likelihood of detecting a drug effect. We conducted two 
      double-blind, randomized crossover experiments in which healthy adults (N = 23, 
      23) performed a reliable and validated visual working memory task (the "Discrete 
      Whole Report task", 90 trials) after administration of THC (7.5 and/or 15 mg 
      oral) or placebo. We also assessed self-reported "mind wandering" (Exp 1) and 
      metacognitive accuracy about ongoing task performance (Exp 2). THC impaired 
      working memory performance (d = 0.65), increased mind wandering (Exp 1), and 
      decreased metacognitive accuracy about task performance (Exp 2). Thus, our 
      findings indicate that THC does impair visual working memory, and that this 
      impairment may be related to both increased mind wandering and decreased 
      monitoring of task performance. Finally, we used a down-sampling procedure to 
      illustrate the effects of task length and sample size on power to detect the 
      acute effect of THC on working memory.

TI  - Sex differences in the acute effects of smoked cannabis: evidence from a human 
      laboratory study of young adults.
PG  - 305-316
LID - 10.1007/s00213-019-05369-y [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Animal studies have found robust sex differences in the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). 
      However, the human evidence remains equivocal, despite findings that women may 
      experience more severe consequences of cannabis use than men. OBJECTIVES: The 
      objective of this secondary analysis was to examine sex differences in THC 
      pharmacokinetics and in acute subjective, physiological, and cognitive effects of 
      smoked cannabis in a sample of regular cannabis users (use 1-4 days per week) 
      aged 19-25 years. METHODS: Ninety-one healthy young adults were randomized to 
      receive active (12.5% THC; 17 females, 43 males) or placebo (< 0.1% THC; 9 
      females, 21 males) cannabis using a 2:1 allocation ratio. Blood samples to 
      quantify concentrations of THC, 11-OH-THC, and 11-Nor-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH), as 
      well as measures of subjective drug effects, vital signs, and cognition were 
      collected over a period of 6 h following ad libitum smoking of a 750-mg cannabis 
      cigarette. RESULTS: Females smoked less of the cannabis cigarette than males 
      (p = 0.008) and had a lower peak concentration of THC and THC-COOH than males 
      (p ≤ 0.01). Blood THC concentrations remained lower in females even when 
      adjusting for differences in estimated dose of THC inhaled. There was very little 
      evidence of sex differences in visual analog scale (VAS) ratings of subjective 
      drug effects, mood, heart rate, blood pressure, or cognitive effects of cannabis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Females experienced the same acute effects of smoked cannabis as 
      males at a lower observed dose, highlighting the need for more research on sex 
      differences in the pharmacology of THC, especially when administered by routes in 
      which titrating to the desired effect is more difficult (e.g., cannabis edibles).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis is one of the most widely used drugs worldwide. Cannabis use 
      disorder is characterised by recurrent use of cannabis that causes significant 
      clinical and functional impairment. There are no approved pharmacological 
      treatments for cannabis use disorder. One approach is to potentiate 
      endocannabinoid signalling by inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the 
      enzyme that degrades the endocannabinoid anandamide. We aimed to test the 
      efficacy and safety of the FAAH-inhibitor PF-04457845 in reduction of cannabis 
      withdrawal and cannabis use in men who were daily cannabis users. METHODS: We did 
      a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group phase 2a trial at one site in 
      men aged 18-55 years with cannabis dependence according to DSM-IV criteria 
      (equivalent to cannabis use disorder in DSM-5). After baseline assessments, 
      participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive PF-04457845 (4 mg per day) 
      or placebo using a fixed block size of six participants, stratified by severity 
      of cannabis use and desire to quit. Participants were admitted to hospital for 5 
      days (maximum 8 days) to achieve abstinence and precipitate cannabis withdrawal, 
      after which they were discharged to continue the remaining 3 weeks of treatment 
      as outpatients. The primary endpoints were treatment-related differences in 
      cannabis withdrawal symptoms during hospital admission, and week 4 (end of 
      treatment) self-reported cannabis use and urine THC-COOH concentrations in the 
      intention-to-treat population. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      number NCT01618656. FINDINGS: Between Sept 12, 2012, and Jan 18, 2016, 46 men 
      were randomly assigned to PF-04457845 and 24 to placebo. Adherence to study 
      medication was 88%, as confirmed by video-calling and pill count, and 
      corroborated by corresponding drug and anandamide concentrations in blood. 
      Relative to placebo, treatment with PF-04457845 was associated with reduced 
      symptoms of cannabis withdrawal (first day of treatment mean symptom score 11·00 
      [95% CI 7·78-15·57] vs 6·04 [4·43-8·24]; difference 4·96 [0·71-9·21]; 
      p(adj)=0·048; second day of treatment 11·74 [8·28-16·66] vs 6·02 [4·28-8·47]; 
      difference 5·73 [1·13-10·32]; p(adj)=0·035) and related mood symptoms during the 
      inpatient phase. Additionally, treatment with PF-04457845 was associated with 
      lower self-reported cannabis use at 4 weeks (mean 1·27 joints per day [95% CI 
      0·82-1·97] vs 0·40 [0·25-0·62]; difference 0·88 [0·29-1·46]; p=0·0003) and lower 
      urinary THC-COOH concentrations (mean 657·92 ng/mL [95% CI 381·60-1134·30] vs 
      265·55 [175·60-401·57]; difference 392·37 [17·55-767·18)]; p=0·009). Eight (17%) 
      patients in the PF-04457845 group and four (17%) in the placebo group 
      discontinued during the treatment period. During the 4-week treatment phase, 20 
      (43%) of 46 participants in the PF-04457845 group and 11 (46%) of 24 participants 
      in the placebo group had an adverse event. There were no serious adverse events. 
      INTERPRETATION: PF-04457845, a novel FAAH inhibitor, reduced cannabis withdrawal 
      symptoms and cannabis use in men, and might represent an effective and safe 
      approach for the treatment of cannabis use disorder. FUNDING: United States

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited empirical integration between peer clustering theory 
      and the Gateway framework. The goal of the present study was to test the 
      hypothesis that friendship associations partly predict gateway escalations in the 
      use of drugs from adolescence to adulthood. METHOD: This longitudinal study 
      analyzed 3 waves of data from a community sample of 711 male and female 
      participants without a history of illicit drug use reporting drug use at age 17, 
      22, and 27. Substance use assessments including tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, onset 
      and abuse/dependence tendency of illicit drugs other than cannabis (i.e., 
      cocaine, methamphetamine, and opiates), and friends' reported use of illicit 
      drugs. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized model. 
      RESULTS: Participants' cannabis use level at age 17 was positively associated 
      with perceived friends' drug use at age 22, which in turn predicted participants' 
      onset of illicit drug use between ages 22 and 27. Moreover, progression of 
      tobacco use throughout age 17 to 22 was associated with an increased onset of 
      illicit drug use between ages 22 and 27. Apart for an effect of cannabis use at 
      age 22 on abuse and dependence tendency to various drugs at age 28, results were 
      similar. CONCLUSIONS: During this period of development, the availability and 
      selection of drug-using friends contributes to the progression to potentially 
      more rewarding and damaging illicit drugs. These findings suggest the need to 
      attend to the peer ecology in prevention and support the common practice of using 
      abstaining peers in treatment for drug dependence.

TI  - Cannabidiol (CBD) content in vaporized cannabis does not prevent 
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-induced impairment of driving and cognition.
PG  - 2713-2724
LID - 10.1007/s00213-019-05246-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main psychoactive component of cannabis, 
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can impair driving performance. Cannabidiol 
      (CBD), a non-intoxicating cannabis component, is thought to mitigate certain 
      adverse effects of THC. It is possible then that cannabis containing equivalent 
      CBD and THC will differentially affect driving and cognition relative to 
      THC-dominant cannabis. AIMS: The present study investigated and compared the 
      effects of THC-dominant and THC/CBD equivalent cannabis on simulated driving and 
      cognitive performance. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, within-subjects 
      crossover design, healthy volunteers (n = 14) with a history of light cannabis 
      use attended three outpatient experimental test sessions in which simulated 
      driving and cognitive performance were assessed at two timepoints (20-60 min and 
      200-240 min) following vaporization of 125 mg THC-dominant (11% THC; < 1% CBD), 
      THC/CBD equivalent (11% THC, 11% CBD), or placebo (< 1% THC/CBD) cannabis. 
      RESULTS/OUTCOMES: Both active cannabis types increased lane weaving during a 
      car-following task but had little effect on other driving performance measures. 
      Active cannabis types impaired performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Task 
      (DSST), Divided Attention Task (DAT) and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task 
      (PASAT) with impairment on the latter two tasks worse with THC/CBD equivalent 
      cannabis. Subjective drug effects (e.g., "stoned") and confidence in driving 
      ability did not vary with CBD content. Peak plasma THC concentrations were higher 
      following THC/CBD equivalent cannabis relative to THC-dominant cannabis, 
      suggesting a possible pharmacokinetic interaction. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: 
      Cannabis containing equivalent concentrations of CBD and THC appears no less 
      impairing than THC-dominant cannabis, and in some circumstances, CBD may actually 
      exacerbate THC-induced impairment.

TI  - Opioid Misuse as a Predictor of Alcohol Treatment Outcomes in the COMBINE Study: 
      Mediation by Medication Adherence.
PG  - 1249-1259
LID - 10.1111/acer.13772 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol is often consumed with opioids and alcohol misuse interferes 
      with treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). Drug misuse is associated with 
      worse alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment outcomes, yet no studies have 
      investigated the role of opioid misuse in AUD treatment outcomes. METHODS: We 
      conducted secondary analyses of the medication conditions of the COMBINE study 
      (n = 1,226), a randomized clinical trial of medications (acamprosate and/or 
      naltrexone) and behavioral interventions (medication management and/or behavioral 
      intervention) for alcohol dependence. We examined associations between baseline 
      opioid misuse and the use of cannabis and other drugs with time to first drinking 
      day, time to first heavy drinking day, and the frequency and intensity of 
      drinking during treatment and 1 year following treatment, based on latent profile 
      analysis. Opioid misuse was defined as use of illicit or prescription opioids 
      without a prescription or not as directed in the previous 6 months, in the 
      absence of OUD. Self-reported cannabis and other drug use were also examined. 
      Seventy individuals (5.7%) met the opioid misuse definition and 542 (44.2%) 
      reported use of cannabis or other drugs without opioid misuse. We also examined 
      medication adherence as a potential mediator. RESULTS: Baseline opioid misuse 
      significantly predicted the time to first heavy drinking day (OR = 1.38 [95% CI: 
      1.13, 1.64], p = 0.001) and a higher probability of being in a heavier and more 
      frequent drinking profile at the end of treatment (OR = 2.90 [95% CI: 1.43, 
      5.90], p = 0.003), and at 1 year following treatment (OR = 2.66 [95% CI: 1.26, 
      5.59], p = 0.01). Cannabis and other drug use also predicted outcomes. Medication 
      adherence partially mediated the association between opioid misuse, cannabis use, 
      other drug use, and treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Opioid misuse and other drug 
      use were associated with poorer AUD treatment outcomes, which was partially 
      mediated by medication adherence. Clinicians and researchers should assess opioid 
      misuse and other drug use in patients undergoing AUD treatment.

TI  - A placebo controlled study of quetiapine-XR in bipolar depression accompanied by 
      generalized anxiety with and without a recent history of alcohol and cannabis 
      use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare treatment response in bipolar I or II 
      depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with and without recent alcohol 
      and/or cannabis use disorder (ALC/CAN) to quetiapine-XR (extended release) or 
      placebo. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, 8-week study of quetiapine-XR 
      versus placebo in patients with bipolar I or II depression and GAD with or 
      without a recent ALC/CAN was used to compare changes in Hamilton Depression 
      Rating Scale-17, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the 16-item Quick Inventory of 
      Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16), Clinical Global Impression 
      for Bipolar Disorder-Severity (CGI-BP-S), and Timeline Follow Back within and 
      between groups. RESULTS: In the quetiapine-XR group, patients with a recent 
      ALC/CAN (n = 22) had significant decreases in QIDS-SR-16 (-9.6 ± 1.6 vs. 
      -3.7 ± 1.7) and CGI-BP-S (-1.6 ± 0.4 vs. -0.8 ± 0.03) than those without a recent 
      ALC/CAN (n = 24). In the placebo group, both patients with a recent ALC/CAN 
      (n = 23) and those without (n = 21) had similar reductions in these measures. The 
      reduction of QIDS-SR-16 scores in patients with a recent ALC/CAN was also 
      significantly different from that of their counterparts in the placebo group. 
      Patients who received quetiapine-XR had larger decreases in the number of 
      drinking days/week (p = 0.17) and number of cannabis joints/week (p = 0.09) 
      compared to those who received placebo. CONCLUSION: Quetiapine-XR was superior to 
      placebo in reducing QIDS-SR-16 total score in patients with a recent ALC/CAN. 
      Patients taking quetiapine-XR used less alcohol and cannabis than patients on 
      placebo, suggesting that quetiapine-XR may be of use in patients with bipolar 
      disorder accompanied by GAD and other comorbidities.

TI  - Appetitive startle modulation in the human laboratory predicts Cannabis craving 
      in the natural environment.
PG  - 1933-1943

AB  - RATIONALE: Drug-related cues evoke craving and stimulate motivational systems in 
      the brain. The acoustic startle reflex captures activation of these motivational 
      processes and affords a unique measure of reactivity to drug cues. OBJECTIVES: 
      This study examined the effects of cannabis-related cues on subjective and eye 
      blink startle reactivity in the human laboratory and tested whether these effects 
      predicted youth's cue-elicited cannabis craving in the natural environment. 
      METHODS: Participants were 55 frequent cannabis users, ages 16 to 24 years 
      (M = 19.9, SD = 1.9; 55% male; 56% met criteria for cannabis dependence), who 
      were recruited from a clinical trial to reduce cannabis use. Eye blink 
      electromyographic activity was recorded in response to acoustic probes that 
      elicited startle reactivity while participants viewed pleasant, unpleasant, 
      neutral, and cannabis picture cues. Following the startle assessment, 
      participants completed an ecological momentary assessment protocol that involved 
      repeated assessments of cue-elicited craving in real time in their real-world 
      environments. RESULTS: Multilevel models included the presence or absence of 
      visible cannabis cues in the natural environment, startle magnitude, and the 
      cross-level interaction of cues by startle to test whether cue-modulated startle 
      reactivity in the laboratory was associated with cue-elicited craving in the 
      natural environment. Analyses showed that cannabis-related stimuli evoked an 
      appetitive startle response pattern in the laboratory, and this effect was 
      associated with increased cue-elicited craving in the natural environment, b = - 
      0.15, p = .022, 95% CI [- 0.28, - 0.02]. Pleasant stimuli also evoked an 
      appetitive response pattern, but in this case, blunted response was associated 
      with increased cue-elicited craving in the natural environment, b = 0.27, 
      p < .001, 95% CI [0.12, 0.43]. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support cue-modulated 
      startle reactivity as an index of the phenotypic expression of cue-elicited 
      cannabis craving.

TI  - Examining effects of medical cannabis narratives on beliefs, attitudes, and

AB  - BACKGROUND: This experimental study tests effects of exposure to video narratives 
      about successful symptom relief with Medical Cannabis (MC) on attitudes, beliefs, 
      and intentions related to recreational cannabis use. METHODS: Patient video 
      testimonials were modeled after those found in extant media coverage. Israeli 
      participants (N = 396) recruited through an online survey company were randomly 
      assigned to view a narrative or a non-narrative video containing equivalent 
      information about MC. Video content was further manipulated based on whether the 
      protagonist had a stigmatized disease or not, and whether attribution of 
      responsibility for his disease was internal or external. RESULTS: Exposure to 
      patient testimonials indirectly increased positive attitudes, beliefs and 
      intentions related to recreational cannabis use through changing attitudes, 
      beliefs and intentions related to MC. Furthermore, exposure to narratives in 
      which the patient was presented as not to blame for contracting his illness 
      (external attribution) was associated with more positive attitudes, beliefs and 
      intentions toward MC, a factor that was significantly associated with more 
      positive attitudes, beliefs and intentions related to recreational cannabis use. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that narrative news media coverage of MC may 
      influence public attitudes toward recreational cannabis. Because such media 
      stories continue to be commonplace, it is important to examine potential 
      spillover effects of this coverage on public perceptions of recreational 
      cannabis. Cannabis prevention programs should address the role of media coverage 
      in shaping public opinion and address the distinction between medical and 
      recreational cannabis use.

TI  - Nabiximols combined with motivational enhancement/cognitive behavioral therapy 
      for the treatment of cannabis dependence: A pilot randomized clinical trial.
PG  - e0190768

LID - e0190768
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current lack of pharmacological treatments for cannabis use 
      disorder (CUD) warrants novel approaches and further investigation of promising 
      pharmacotherapy. We previously showed that nabiximols (27 mg/ml 
      Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)/ 25 mg/ml cannabidiol (CBD), Sativex®) can decrease 
      cannabis withdrawal symptoms. Here, we assessed in a pilot study the tolerability 
      and safety of self-titrated nabiximols vs. placebo among 40 treatment-seeking 
      cannabis-dependent participants. METHODS: Subjects participated in a double blind 
      randomized clinical trial, with as-needed nabiximols up to 113.4 mg THC/105 mg 
      CBD or placebo daily for 12 weeks, concurrently with Motivational Enhancement 
      Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT). Primary outcome measures were 
      tolerability and abstinence, secondary outcome measures were days and amount of 
      cannabis use, withdrawal, and craving scores. Participants received up to CDN$ 
      855 in compensation for their time. RESULTS: Medication was well tolerated and no 
      serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed. Rates of adverse events did not 
      differ between treatment arms (F1,39 = 0.205, NS). There was no significant 
      change in abstinence rates at trial end. Participants were not able to 
      differentiate between subjective effects associated with nabiximols or placebo 
      treatments (F1,40 = 0.585, NS). Cannabis use was reduced in the nabiximols 
      (70.5%) and placebo groups (42.6%). Nabiximols reduced cannabis craving but no 
      significant differences between the nabiximols and placebo groups were observed 
      on withdrawal scores. CONCLUSIONS: Nabiximols in combination with MET/CBT was 
      well tolerated and allowed for reduction of cannabis use. Future clinical trials 
      should explore the potential of high doses of nabiximols for cannabis dependence.

TI  - Results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, 
      multimodal-MRI pilot study of gabapentin for co-occurring bipolar and cannabis 
      use disorders.

AB  - Disrupted brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/glutamate homeostasis is a 
      promising target for pharmacological intervention in co-occurring bipolar 
      disorder (BD) and cannabis use disorder (CUD). Gabapentin is a safe and 
      well-tolerated medication, FDA-approved to treat other neurological diseases, 
      that restores GABA/glutamate homeostasis, with treatment studies supporting 
      efficacy in treating CUD, as well as anxiety and sleep disorders that are common 
      to both BD and CUD. The present manuscript represents the primary report of a 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover (1-week/condition), 
      multimodal-MRI (proton-MR spectroscopy, functional MRI) pilot study of gabapentin 
      (1200 mg/day) in BD + CUD (n = 22). Primary analyses revealed that (1) gabapentin 
      was well tolerated and adherence and retention were high, (2) gabapentin 
      increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right basal ganglia (rBG) 
      glutamate levels and (3) gabapentin increased activation to visual cannabis cues 
      in the posterior midcingulate cortex (pMCC, a region involved in response 
      inhibition to rewarding stimuli). Exploratory evaluation of clinical outcomes 
      further found that in participants taking gabapentin versus placebo, (1) 
      elevations of dACC GABA levels were associated with lower manic/mixed and 
      depressive symptoms and (2) elevations of rBG glutamate levels and pMCC 
      activation to cannabis cues were associated with lower cannabis use. Though 
      promising, the findings from this study should be interpreted with caution due to 
      observed randomization order effects on dACC glutamate levels and identification 
      of statistical moderators that differed by randomization order (i.e. 
      cigarette-smoking status on rBG glutamate levels and pMCC cue activation). 
      Nonetheless, they provide the necessary foundation for a more robustly designed 
      (urn-randomized, parallel-group) future study of adjuvant gabapentin for 
      BD + CUD.

AB  - Cannabis use has been associated with psychosis and cognitive dysfunction. Some 
      evidence suggests that the acute behavioral and neurocognitive effects of the 
      main active ingredient in cannabis, (-)-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (∆9-THC), 
      might be modulated by previous cannabis exposure. However, this has not been 
      investigated either using a control group of non-users, or following abstinence 
      in modest cannabis users, who represent the majority of recreational users. 
      Twenty-four healthy men participated in a double-blind, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled, repeated-measures, within-subject, ∆9-THC challenge study. 
      Compared to non-users (N=12; <5 lifetime cannabis joints smoked), abstinent 
      modest cannabis users (N=12; 24.5±9 lifetime cannabis joints smoked) showed worse 
      performance and stronger right hemispheric activation during cognitive 
      processing, independent of the acute challenge (all P≤0.047). Acute ∆9-THC 
      administration produced transient anxiety and psychotomimetic symptoms (all 
      P≤0.02), the latter being greater in non-users compared to users (P=0.040). 
      Non-users under placebo (control group) activated specific brain areas to perform 
      the tasks, while deactivating others. An opposite pattern was found under acute 
      (∆9-THC challenge in non-users) as well as residual (cannabis users under 
      placebo) effect of ∆9-THC. Under ∆9-THC, cannabis users showed brain activity 
      patterns intermediate between those in non-users under placebo (control group), 
      and non-users under ∆9-THC (acute effect) and cannabis users under placebo 
      (residual effect). In non-users, the more severe the ∆9-THC-induced 
      psychotomimetic symptoms and cognitive impairments, the more pronounced was the 
      neurophysiological alteration (all P≤0.036). Previous modest cannabis use blunts 
      the acute behavioral and neurophysiological effects of ∆9-THC, which are more 
      marked in people who have never used cannabis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined how Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main 
      psychoactive component of cannabis, impacts brain reward circuitry in humans. In 
      this study, we examined if an acute dose of THC altered resting state functional 
      connectivity between the striatum and prefrontal cortex among healthy young 
      adults with limited cannabis use. METHODS: Participants received THC (n = 24) or 
      placebo (n = 22) in a double-blind, randomized, between-subject design. 
      Participants completed self-report measures of euphoria and drug-liking 
      throughout the visit. Approximately 120 min after drug administration, 
      participants completed an 8-min resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scan. We 
      utilized seed-based connectivity of the striatum (bilateral putamen, caudate, and 
      NAcc seeds) to the frontal cortex. RESULTS: Individuals who received THC 
      demonstrated greater rs-fMRI connectivity between the right NAcc and regions of 
      the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (p-values<0.05, corrected) and higher 
      subjective euphoria ratings (p = .03) compared to compared to individuals who 
      received placebo. Higher ratings of euphoria were related to greater right 
      NAcc-dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) connectivity for the THC group (p=.03), but not for the 
      placebo group (p=.98). CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to examine 
      rs-fMRI connectivity in healthy young non-users after THC administration. We 
      found individuals receiving THC show greater rs-fMRI connectivity between the 
      NAcc and mPFC, regions implicated in reward, compared to individuals receiving 
      placebo. In addition, individuals receiving THC reported higher subjective 
      euphoria ratings, which were positively associated with NAcc-dmPFC connectivity. 
      Overall, our findings suggest THC may produce subjective and neural reward 
      responses that contribute to the rewarding, reinforcing properties of cannabis.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Annual preventive health visits provide an opportunity to screen 
      youths for unhealthy substance use and intervene before serious harm results. 
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility and acceptability and estimate the efficacy 
      of a primary care computer-facilitated screening and practitioner-delivered brief 
      intervention (CSBI) system compared with usual care (UC) for youth substance use 
      and associated risk of riding with an impaired driver. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: An intent-to-treat pilot randomized clinical trial compared CSBI 
      with UC among 965 youths aged 12 to 18 years at 5 pediatric primary care offices 
      and 54 practitioners. Patients were randomized to CSBI (n = 628) or usual care 
      (n = 243) groups within practitioner with 12 months of follow-up. Data were 
      collected from February 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017. Data analysis was 
      performed January 1, 2018, to March 30, 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Patients 
      self-administered a computer-facilitated substance use screening questionnaire 
      before their annual preventive health visits. Immediately after completing the 
      screening, they received their score and level of risk and viewed 10 pages of 
      scientific information and true-life vignettes illustrating health risks 
      associated with substance use. Trained practitioners received the screening 
      results, patients' risk levels, talking points designed to prompt brief 
      counseling, and recommended follow-up plans. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Feasibility and acceptability were assessed using adolescents' postvisit ratings. 
      Days of alcohol use, cannabis use, and heavy episodic drinking were assessed at 
      baseline and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups using Timeline Followback, and 
      riding in the past 3 months with a driver who was impaired by use of alcohol or 
      other drugs was assessed using 2 self-report items. The primary outcome was the 
      intervention effect among at-risk youths who reported using alcohol or other 
      drugs in the past 12 months or riding with an impaired driver in the past 3 
      months at baseline. The secondary outcome was the prevention effect among those 
      with no prior use or risk. RESULTS: Among 871 youths screened, 869 completed the 
      baseline assessment; 211 of the 869 reported alcohol or cannabis use in the past 
      12 months at baseline (mean [SD] age, 16.4 [1.3] years; 114 [54.1%] female; 105 
      [49.8%] non-Hispanic white). Of the 211 youths, 148 (70.1%) were assigned to the 
      CSBI group and 63 (29.9%) were assigned to the UC group. Among youths in the CSBI 
      group, 105 (70.9%) reported receiving counseling about alcohol, 122 (82.4%) 
      reported receiving counseling about cannabis, and 129 (87.2%) reported receiving 
      counseling about not riding with an impaired driver. Adjusted hazard ratios for 
      time to first postvisit use of alcohol or other drugs for CSBI vs UC were as 
      follows: alcohol use, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.47-1.02); heavy episodic drinking, 0.66 
      (95% CI, 0.40-1.10); and cannabis use, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.41-0.94). At 12-month 
      follow-ups among 99 youths who reported having ridden in the past 3 months at 
      baseline with an impaired driver (64 in the CSBI group; 35 in the UC group), 
      adjusted relative risk ratio of riding in the past 3 months with an impaired 
      driver for CSBI vs UC groups was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.37-0.91). No intervention effect 
      was observed among youths who reported no prior use of alcohol or other drugs 
      (n = 658) or not having ridden with an impaired driver (n = 769) at baseline. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The CSBI system is a feasible and acceptable option 
      for screening youths in primary care practice for use of alcohol and other drugs 
      and for risk of riding with an impaired driver, and the estimated efficacy in 
      this sample warrants further testing in larger samples. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Effects of Treatment Length and Chat-Based Counseling in a Web-Based Intervention 
      for Cannabis Users: Randomized Factorial Trial.
PG  - e166
LID - 10.2196/jmir.9579 [doi]
LID - e166
AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital interventions show promise in reducing problematic cannabis 
      use. However, little is known about the effect of moderators in such 
      interventions. The therapist-guided internet intervention Quit the Shit provides 
      50 days of chat-based (synchronous) and time-lagged (asynchronous) counseling. 
      OBJECTIVE: In the study, we examined whether the effectiveness of Quit the Shit 
      is reduced by shortening the program or by removing the chat-based counseling 
      option. METHODS: We conducted a purely Web-based randomized experimental trial 
      using a two-factorial design (factor 1: real-time-counseling via text-chat: yes 
      vs no; factor 2: intervention duration: 50 days vs 28 days). Participants were 
      recruited on the Quit the Shit website. Follow-ups were conducted 3, 6, and 12 
      months after randomization. Primary outcome was cannabis-use days during the past 
      30 days using a Timeline Followback procedure. Secondary outcomes were cannabis 
      quantity, cannabis-use events, cannabis dependency (Severity of Dependence 
      Scale), treatment satisfaction (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire), and working 
      alliance (Working Alliance Inventory-short revised). RESULTS: In total, 534 
      participants were included in the trial. Follow-up rates were 47.2% (252/534) 
      after 3 months, 38.2% (204/534) after 6 months, and 25.3% (135/534) after 12 
      months. Provision of real-time counseling (factor 1) was not significantly 
      associated with any cannabis-related outcome but with higher treatment 
      satisfaction (P=.001, d=0.34) and stronger working alliance (P=.008, d=0.22). In 
      factor 2, no significant differences were found in any outcome. The reduction of 
      cannabis use among all study participants was strong (P<.001, d≥1.13). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The reduction of program length and the waiver of synchronous 
      communication have no meaningful impact on the effectiveness of Quit the Shit. It 
      therefore seems tenable to abbreviate the program and to offer a self-guided 
      start into Quit the Shit. Due to its positive impact on treatment satisfaction 
      and working alliance, chat-based counseling nevertheless should be provided in 
      Quit the Shit. TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomized Controlled

TI  - Effectiveness of Fresh Start: A Randomized Study of a School-Based Program to 
      Retain a Negative Attitude Toward Substance Use in Secondary School Freshmen.
PG  - 921-930
LID - 10.1080/10826084.2017.1385082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The transition to secondary school is linked to more positive 
      attitudes toward substance use, which prelude the moment of first use. Fresh 
      Start is a school-based prevention program for secondary school freshmen 
      (12-13 years old) to retain negative attitudes. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates 
      the effectiveness of Fresh Start on the attitudes toward smoking, alcohol use, 
      and cannabis use, and on multiple secondary outcome measures. In addition, the 
      effect of timing of the program within the schoolyear was examined. METHODS: A 
      cluster randomized trial was conducted. 48 classes, containing 1083 secondary 
      school freshmen, were randomly allocated to the experimental or waiting list 
      control condition. Experimental classes completed Fresh Start between October 
      2015 and January 2016 and waiting list control classes completed Fresh Start 
      between March 2016 and May 2016. Measurements were scheduled at three points in 
      time (September 2015, February 2016, and June 2016). Data were analyzed by means 
      of multilevel analyses. RESULTS: Fresh Start had small but significant effects on 
      the attitudes toward smoking, alcohol use and cannabis use. The majority of 
      secondary outcome measures were not influenced by Fresh Start, although a small, 
      adverse effect was found on the perceived social acceptance of cannabis use by 
      friends. Timing of the intervention within the schoolyear did not influence its 
      effectiveness. Conclusions/Importance: Fresh Start can help to delay the 
      development of positive attitudes toward substance use in secondary school 
      freshmen. Strengths and limitations, implications for practice and suggestions 
      for future research are discussed.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the mediating effects of normative beliefs of drug use on 
      the effects of the #Tamojunto school-based prevention program (Unplugged). 
      DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING: 
      Brazil. Participants: A total of 6,391 adolescents (12.68 y.o) from 72 public 
      schools in 6 Brazilian cities. Intervention: Schools were assigned to an 
      experimental condition (#Tamojunto curriculum) or a control condition (no 
      prevention program). Measurements: Baseline data were collected prior to program 
      implementation, and follow-up data were collected 9 and 21 months later. The 
      substances examined were alcohol (including binge drinking), tobacco, marijuana 
      and inhalants. Five in-parallel mediation models evaluated whether the positive 
      and negative beliefs were mediators of the likely effects of the intervention on 
      drug use. FINDINGS: Lack of evidences regarding differences in normative beliefs 
      or drug use were found between the intervention and control groups. However, 
      there was a clear association between negative drug beliefs and lower consumption 
      (i.e. OR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.70; 0.87, for cannabis use) as well as between positive 
      drug beliefs and higher consumption (i.e. OR = 1.77; 95% CI 1.56; 2.02, for 
      cannabis use) independent of the assigned group. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      suggest that there is a lack of evidence that the program impact the normative 
      beliefs, as proposed by the theoretical model of the program, suggesting that 
      modifications are needed to produce the intended effect of the program. Negative 
      normative beliefs seem to be a potential protective factor for drug use, but the 
      program's effect itself on drug use via normative beliefs was not found to be 
      statistically significant. Program activities intended to affect normative 
      beliefs should be improved.

TI  - Telephone veteran peer coaching for mental health treatment engagement among 
      rural veterans: The importance of secondary outcomes and qualitative data in a 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 788-800
LID - 10.1111/jrh.12582 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness of telephone motivational coaching 
      delivered by veteran peers to improve mental health (MH) treatment engagement 
      among veterans. METHODS: Veterans receiving primary care from primarily rural VA 
      community-based outpatient clinics were enrolled. Veterans not engaged in MH 
      treatment screening positive for ≥1 MH problem(s) were randomized to receive 
      veteran peer-delivered feedback on MH screen results and referrals plus 4 
      sessions of telephone motivational coaching (intervention) versus veteran 
      peer-delivered MH results and referrals without motivational coaching (control). 
      Blinded telephone assessments were conducted at baseline, 8, 16, and 32 weeks. 
      Cox proportional hazard models compared MH clinician-directed treatment 
      initiation between groups; descriptive analyses compared MH treatment retention, 
      changes in MH symptoms, quality of life, and self-care. FINDINGS: Among 272 
      veterans screening positive for ≥1 MH problem(s), 45% who received veteran peer 
      telephone motivational coaching versus 46% of control participants initiated MH 
      treatment (primary outcome) (hazard ratio: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.76-1.57), representing 
      no between-group differences. In contrast, veterans receiving veteran peer 
      motivational coaching achieved significantly greater improvements in depression, 
      posttraumatic stress disorder and cannabis use scores, quality of life domains, 
      and adoption of some self-care strategies than controls (secondary outcomes). 
      Qualitative data revealed that veterans who received veteran peer motivational 
      coaching may no longer have perceived a need for MH treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Among 
      veterans with MH problems using predominantly rural VA community clinics, 
      telephone peer motivational coaching did not enhance MH treatment engagement, but 
      instead had positive effects on MH symptoms, quality of life indicators, and use 
      of self-care strategies.

AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize information elicited from adolescent/young adults with 
      frequent cannabis use in Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), and determine 
      whether differences exist across stages of change (SOC) for reducing use. DESIGN 
      AND METHODS: Primary care patients 15-24 years old using cannabis ≥3 times/week 
      enrolled in a pilot randomized intervention trial. All youth were offered two 
      1-hour MET sessions. Content analysis was used to code and categorize main 
      reasons for use, alternative behaviors, goals, values, pros and cons of change, 
      and compared results between youth in Pre-Contemplation vs. Contemplation SOC. 
      RESULTS: Fifty-six youth completed MET session 1, 46 completed session 2. Most 
      reported their main reason for use was related to emotional coping, negative 
      feelings were a top-3 trigger, and distraction was an alternative way to meet 
      their needs. Youth most frequently described progress in education or career/job 
      as 1-year goals. More than half identified family as a very important value. They 
      most frequently reported pros of using less related to achieving goals, 
      self-improving, and saving money, and a con related to stress/coping. Compared to 
      youth in Pre-Contemplation SOC, those in Contemplation were more likely to 
      identify relationships as both a pro and con of using less cannabis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      MET can reveal developmentally appropriate goals, healthy values, and ambivalence 
      about cannabis use that can be used to facilitate movement along the stages of 
      behavior change toward reduction/cessation. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Brief 
      motivational therapy can be used in primary care to gather information important 
      in helping youth to reduce cannabis use.

TI  - Are perceptions of social norms regarding peer alcohol and other drug use 
      associated with personal use in Danish adolescents?
PG  - 757-764
LID - 10.1177/1403494817724313 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study aims to describe norm perceptions among Danish pupils aged 13-17 
      years related to the prevalence of personal lifetime use of alcohol and other 
      drugs (AODs). Further we examined if norm perceptions were associated with 
      personal lifetime AOD use. METHOD: The data were collected as baseline data in 
      the trial The GOOD Life. A total of 2601 pupils from 42 public schools in the 
      Region of Southern Denmark completed an online questionnaire measuring personal 
      lifetime AOD use and personal approval of use. Additionally the perceived 
      frequency of AOD use and approval of use among peers of their own grade were 
      measured. Lifetime AOD outcome variables were alcohol consumption (at least one 
      drink, being drunk and had five or more drinks on one occasion), smoking, and 
      cannabis use. RESULTS: Pupils' perceptions of peer approval were significantly 
      higher than pupils' personal approval of AOD use among adolescents for all 
      outcomes. With the exception of cannabis use the estimated AOD prevalence among 
      peers (median) were higher than the actual prevalence of personal lifetime use. 
      Multilevel logistic regression models showed a significantly increased risk of 
      personal AOD use for pupils that overestimated their peers' AOD use and also for 
      pupils that perceived peers to approve of AOD use. CONCLUSIONS: The findings 
      highlight that pupils' exaggerated perceptions regarding their peers' use and 
      approval of AOD use are related to personal experience with AODs.

TI  - Impact of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition on cannabis withdrawal and circulating 
      endocannabinoids in daily cannabis smokers.
PG  - e13183
LID - 10.1111/adb.13183 [doi]
AB  - Attenuating enzymatic degradation of endocannabinoids (eCBs) by fatty acid amide 
      hydrolase (FAAH) reduces cannabis withdrawal symptoms in preclinical and clinical 
      studies. In mice, blocking cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity increases central 
      eCB levels by inhibiting fatty acid degradation. This placebo-controlled study 
      examined the effects of the FDA-approved COX-2 selective inhibitor, celecoxib, on 
      cannabis withdrawal, 'relapse', and circulating eCBs in a human laboratory model 
      of cannabis use disorder. Daily, nontreatment-seeking cannabis smokers (12M, 3F) 
      completed a crossover study comprising two 11-day study phases (separated by 
      >14 days for medication clearance). In each phase, the effects of daily BID 
      placebo (0 mg) or celecoxib (200 mg) on cannabis (5.3% THC) intoxication, 
      withdrawal symptoms (4 days of inactive cannabis self-administration) and 
      'relapse' (3 days of active cannabis self-administration following abstinence) 
      were assessed. Outcome measures included mood, cannabis self-administration, 
      sleep, food intake, cognitive performance, tobacco cigarette use and circulating 
      eCBs and related lipids. Under placebo maintenance, cannabis abstinence produced 
      characteristic withdrawal symptoms (negative mood, anorexia and dreaming) 
      relative to cannabis administration and was associated with increased OEA (a 
      substrate of FAAH) and oleic acid (metabolite of OEA), with no change in eCB 
      levels. Compared to placebo, celecoxib improved subjective (but not objective) 
      measures of sleep and did not affect mood or plasma levels of eCBs or associated 
      lipids and increased cannabis craving. The overall absence of effects on cannabis 
      withdrawal symptoms, self-administration or circulating eCBs relative to placebo, 
      combined with an increase in cannabis craving, suggests celecoxib does not show 
      promise as a potential pharmacotherapy for CUD.

TI  - The long-term effectiveness of universal, selective and combined prevention for 
      alcohol use during adolescence: 36-month outcomes from a cluster randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 514-524
LID - 10.1111/add.15178 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To compare the long-term universal outcomes of the Climate Schools 
      programme, the selective preventure programme and their combined implementation 
      to standard substance use education in reducing the uptake of alcohol use, 
      engagement in binge drinking and alcohol-related harms over a 3-year period. 
      DESIGN: A cluster-randomized controlled trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Substance use prevention programmes delivered in Australian secondary schools. 
      Students from 26 Australian secondary schools (n = 2190), mean age at baseline 
      13.3 years (standard deviation = 0.48), 57.4% male. Schools were recruited 
      between September 2011 and February 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Schools were 
      block-randomized to one of four groups: universal prevention (climate; 
      12 × 40-minute lessons); selective prevention (preventure; 2 × 90-minute 
      sessions); combined prevention (climate and preventure; CAP); or health education 
      as usual (control). The climate intervention delivered 12 × 40-minute lessons 
      aimed at reducing alcohol and cannabis use and related harms. The preventure 
      intervention delivered 2 × 90-minute group sessions to high-risk students. The 
      CAP group implemented the climate programme to the entire year group and the 
      preventure programme to the high-risk students. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were 
      all consenting 8th grade students (in 2012) assessed at baseline, 
      post-intervention (6-9 months post-baseline) and at 12, 24 and 36 months 
      post-baseline on measures of alcohol use, knowledge and related harms. Primary 
      outcomes were alcohol use, binge drinking (five or more standard drinks) and 
      alcohol-related harms, obtained from all students regardless of whether or not 
      they received intervention. Intervention effects at 36 months post-baseline were 
      estimated from generalized multi-level mixed models using data from all 
      time-points and accounting for school-level clustering. Exploratory analyses 
      examined intervention effects among low- and high-risk adolescents. FINDINGS: 
      Compared with students in the control condition, students in the climate, 
      preventure and CAP groups demonstrated significantly slower increases in their 
      likelihood to drink any alcohol [odds ratio (OR) = 0.64, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) = 0.50-0.82 for climate; OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.43-0.71 for preventure and 
      OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.53-0.84 for CAP] to engage in binge drinking (OR = 0.60, 
      95% CI = 0.44-0.82 for climate; OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.44-0.80 for preventure and 
      OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.51-0.92 for CAP) and to experience alcohol harms 
      (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.49-0.82 for climate; OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.43-0.71 for 
      preventure and OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.50-0.81 for CAP). There was no strong 
      evidence that the combined approach showed advantages over universal prevention. 
      The direction and magnitude of effects were consistent in low- and high-risk 
      adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The universal Climate Schools programme and the 
      selective preventure programme were effective in reducing alcohol consumption and 
      alcohol problems compared with standard Australian health education, when 
      trialled individually and together over a 3-year period.

TI  - Multiple Health Risk Behaviors in Young Adult Smokers: Stages of Change and 
      Stability over Time.
PG  - 75-86
LID - 10.1093/abm/kaz025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health risk behaviors (HRBs) are common, yet not well understood in 
      young adult smokers. PURPOSE: We examined HRB profiles over 12 months in young 
      adult smokers participating in a Facebook smoking cessation intervention clinical 
      trial. METHODS: Participants (N = 500; age M = 20.9 years; 54.6% women) were 
      recruited online and randomized to receive either a 3-month Facebook smoking 
      cessation intervention or referral to Smokefree.gov (control). A Health Risk 
      Assessment determined risk for 10 behaviors at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. 
      Latent class analysis (LCA) and latent transition analysis (LTA) were used to 
      identify patterns of HRBs and changes over time. RESULTS: At baseline, 
      participants reported an average of 5.4 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.7) risk 
      behaviors, including smoking (100%), high-fat diet (84.8%), poor sleep hygiene 
      (71.6%), and low fruit and vegetable intake (69.4%). A 3-class model fit the data 
      best at baseline and all follow-up time points: low risk (28.8% at baseline) with 
      low likelihood of risk on all behaviors except smoking, substance use risk (14.0% 
      at baseline) characterized by heavy episodic drinking, cannabis use, and other 
      illicit drug use, and metabolic risk (57.2% at baseline), with a high percentage 
      of members at risk for a low fruit and vegetable intake, high-fat diet, 
      inactivity, stress, and poor sleep hygiene. Classes were very stable at 3, 6, and 
      12 months, with few participants transitioning between classes. CONCLUSIONS: Most 
      young adult smokers engaged in multiple risk behaviors, with meaningful 
      clustering of behaviors, and demonstrated stability over a year's time. In 
      addition to smoking, targets for intervention are co-occurring substance use and 
      metabolic risk behaviors. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT02207036.

AB  - Lifetime co-occurring substance use disorders are common at the time of 
      presentation for treatment of a first episode of primary psychosis and persistent 
      substance use disorder (SUD) leads to poorer outcomes. We assessed whether the 
      NAVIGATE program, a coordinated specialty care service that includes optional 
      substance abuse content reduced substance use compared to usual care in 404 
      individuals in the Recovery After Initial Schizophrenia Episode-Early Treatment 
      Program (RAISE-ETP) study. Participants were randomized to two years of NAVIGATE 
      (n = 223) or usual care (n = 181) and assessed monthly for substance use. At 
      baseline, over one-half (51.7%) of the participants met criteria for a lifetime 
      SUD, including over one-third with alcohol use disorder (36.4%) and with cannabis 
      use disorder (34.7%). Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no treatment group by 
      time interaction effect on days of self-reported substance use over the two-year 
      follow-up. Participant exposure to the substance abuse component of the NAVIGATE 
      program was low, suggesting that modifications to the program and training method 
      for clinicians may be needed. Further research is needed to determine the most 
      effective strategies for addressing substance use disorders in persons recovering 
      from a first episode of psychosis.

TI  - Mood, sleep and pain comorbidity outcomes in cannabis dependent patients: 
      Findings from a nabiximols versus placebo randomised controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mood, sleep and pain problems are common comorbidities among 
      treatment-seeking cannabis-dependent patients. There is limited evidence 
      suggesting treatment for cannabis dependence is associated with their 
      improvement. This study explored the impact of cannabis dependence treatment on 
      these comorbidities. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis from a 12-week 
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial testing the efficacy of a cannabis agonist 
      (nabiximols) against placebo in reducing illicit cannabis use in 128 
      cannabis-dependent participants. Outcome measurements including DASS-21 
      (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress subscales); Insomnia Severity Index (ISI); and 
      Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), were performed at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24. Each was 
      analysed as continuous outcomes and as binary cases based on validated clinical 
      cut-offs. RESULTS: Among those whose DASS and ISI scores were in the moderate to 
      severe range at baseline, after controlling for cannabis use, there was a gradual 
      decrease in severity of symptoms over the course of the trial. BPI decreased 
      significantly until week 12 and then rose again in the post-treatment period 
      during weeks 12-24. Neither pharmacotherapy type (nabiximols vs placebo) nor 
      number of counselling sessions contributed significant explanatory power to any 
      of the models and were excluded from the final analyses for both continuous and 
      categorical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Participants in this trial who qualified as 
      cases at baseline had elevated comorbidity symptoms. There was no evidence that 
      nabiximols treatment is a barrier to achieving reductions in the comorbid 
      symptoms examined. Cannabis dependence treatment reduced illicit cannabis use and 
      improved comorbidity symptoms, even when complete abstinence was not achieved.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to assess the prevalence and clinical correlates of 
      Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD) in adults with 
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Participants were 102 adults (Female= 
      27), aged 18-65 (mean age= 28.2 years), with ADHD diagnosed in adulthood. ADHD 
      and DSPD diagnosis were made according to DSM-5 criteria. Assessing instruments 
      included the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, the brief Temperament 
      Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego Questionnaire, the Barratt 
      Impulsiveness Scale, the Reactivity Intensity Polarity Stability Questionnaire-40 
      and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. 
      Epidemiological and Clinical features were compared in patients with and without 
      DSPD. 34 out of 102 patients were classified as having a Delayed Sleep Phase 
      Disorder. As expected, DSPD patients reported a more frequent evening chronotype. 
      In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder 
      was significantly associated with young age, cannabis use, cyclothymic 
      temperamental traits and severe global impairment. An early diagnosis with a 
      proper treatment targeted to both disorders may be fundamental in order to 
      improve the overall functioning and the outcome of adult ADHD patients.

TI  - Perceptions of plain packaging and health warning labels for cannabis among young 
      adults: findings from an experimental study.
PG  - 1361

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is strong evidence that plain cigarette packaging and health 
      warning labels (HWLs) reduce brand appeal and increase health knowledge. There is 
      limited evidence examining this population-level public health approach for 
      cannabis packaging. This issue is of particular importance in light of the recent 
      legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada. The current study examined 
      perceptions of plain packaging and HWLs for cannabis packages among young adults. 
      METHODS: An online experimental study was conducted with a sample of university 
      students in Alberta, Canada (n = 656). Respondents were randomly assigned to view 
      cannabis packages in one of four conditions: Condition 1: branded pack, Condition 
      2: plain pack (uniform color, brand imagery removed, standardized font), 
      Condition 3: branded pack with a HWL, and Condition 4: plain pack with a HWL. 
      Respondents in Conditions 3 and 4 viewed five text-based HWLs, each corresponding 
      to a health effect associated with cannabis use: (1) brain development, (2) 
      mental health issues, (3) impaired driving, (4) nonlethal overdose, and (5) 
      addiction. After viewing packs, respondents rated packs and health warnings on 
      various measures. RESULTS: Branded packages without HWLs were rated as most 
      appealing compared to all other packs (p < 0.001 for all contrasts). No 
      differences were found in ratings of appeal when comparing branded and plain 
      packs with HWLs. Warning messages for cognitive development and impaired driving 
      were rated highest on levels of perceived effectiveness, believability, and fear, 
      whereas the addiction warning was rated among the lowest. In general, there were 
      gaps in health knowledge related to cannabis use, however after viewing packs 
      with warnings (compared to viewing packs without warnings) levels of health 
      knowledge increased across all health effects (p < 0.01 for all). Lastly, a 
      significant majority of young adults reported they would purchase the branded 
      pack without a HWL (39.5%), compared to all other pack types (p < 0.05 for all 
      contrasts). The lowest proportion of young adults reported they would purchase a 
      plain pack with a HWL (1.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Plain packaging and health warnings 
      may reduce brand appeal and increase health knowledge among young adults.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Characterization of 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol in 
      Urine Following Acute Oral Cannabis Ingestion in Healthy Adults.
PG  - 232-247
LID - 10.1093/jat/bkx102 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the urine excretion profile for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 
      metabolites is important for accurate detection and interpretation of 
      toxicological testing for cannabis use. Prior literature has primarily evaluated 
      the urinary pharmacokinetics of the non-psychoactive THC metabolite 
      11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) following smoked cannabis 
      administration. The present study examined the urine THCCOOH excretion profile 
      following oral cannabis administration in 18 healthy adults. Following ingestion 
      of a cannabis-containing brownie with 10, 25 or 50 mg of THC (N = 6 per dose), 
      urine specimens were collected on a closed residential research unit for 6 days, 
      followed by three outpatient visits on Days 7-9. Average maximum concentrations 
      (Cmax) of THCCOOH were 107, 335 and 713 ng/mL, and average times to maximum 
      concentration (Tmax) were 8, 6 and 9 h for the 10, 25 and 50 mg THC doses, 
      respectively. Detection windows to first positive and last positive varied as a 
      function of dose; higher doses had shorter time to first positive and longer time 
      to last positive. Considerable inter-subject variability was observed on study 
      outcomes. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS; 15 ng/mL cutoff) was used 
      as the criterion to assess sensitivity, specificity and agreement for THCCOOH 
      qualitative immunoassay tests using 20, 50 and 100 ng/mL cutoffs. The 50 ng/mL 
      cutoff displayed good sensitivity (92.5%), specificity (92.4%) and overall 
      agreement (92.4%), whereas the 20 ng/mL cutoff demonstrated poor specificity 
      (58.4%), and the 100 ng/mL cutoff exhibited reduced sensitivity (70.9%). 
      Ingestion of cannabis brownies containing the 10 and 25 mg THC doses yielded 
      THCCOOH concentrations that differed in magnitude and time course from those 
      previously reported for the smoked route of administration of comparable doses.

TI  - Benign ethnic neutropenia in a South African population, and its association with 
      HIV acquisition and adverse event reporting in an HIV vaccine clinical trial.
PG  - e0241708
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0241708 [doi]
LID - e0241708
AB  - Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is defined as a neutrophil count of <1.5×109 
      cells/L in healthy individuals and is more common in populations of certain 
      ethnicities, e.g. African or Middle Eastern ethnicity. Neutrophil values are 
      commonly included in eligibility criteria for research participation, but little 
      is known about the relationship between BEN, HIV acquisition, and the occurrence 
      of adverse events during clinical trials. We investigated these relationships 
      using data from an HIV vaccine efficacy trial of healthy adults from 5 South 
      African sites. We analysed data from the double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      randomized trial HVTN 503, and its follow-on study HVTN 503-S to assess the 
      prevalence of BEN, its association with HIV infection, and adverse event 
      reporting. These data were then compared with a time- and age-matched, 
      non-pregnant cohort from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
      (NHANES) conducted between 2007-2008 in the United States (US). The 739 South 
      African participants had a median age of 22.0 years (interquartile range = 20-26) 
      and 56% (n = 412) were male. Amongst the US cohort of 845 participants, the 
      median age was 26 (IQR: 21-30) and the majority (54%, 457/745) were also male. 
      BEN was present at enrolment in 7.0% (n = 52) of South African participants (6% 
      in the placebo group versus 8% in the vaccine group); 81% (n = 42) of those with 
      BEN were male. Pretoria North had the highest prevalence of BEN (11.6%, 5/43), 
      while Cape Town had the lowest (0.7%, 1/152). Participants with BEN had a lower 
      median neutrophil count (1.3 vs. 3.2x109 cells/L; p<0.001) and BMI (20.8 vs. 22.3 
      kg/m2; p<0.001) when compared to those without BEN. A greater proportion of Black 
      South Africans had neutrophil counts <1.5×109 cells/L compared to US non-Hispanic 
      Whites from the NHANES cohort (7% [52/739] vs. 0.6% [3/540]; p<0.001). BEN did 
      not increase the odds for HIV infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.364, 95% 
      confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.625-2.976; p = 0.4351). However, female gender 
      (aOR: 1.947, 95% CI: 1.265-2.996; p = 0.0025) and cannabis use (aOR: 2.192, 95% 
      CI: 1.126-4.266; p = 0.0209) increased the odds of HIV acquisition. The incidence 
      rates of adverse events were similar between participants in the placebo group 
      with BEN, and those without: 12.1 (95% CI: 7.3-20.1) vs. 16.5 (95% CI: 14.6-18.7; 
      p = 0.06) events per 100 person-years (py) were noted in the infections and 
      infestations system organ class, respectively. The vaccine group had an event 
      incidence rate of 19.7 (95% CI: 13.3-29.2) vs. 14.8 (95% CI: 13.0-16.8; p = 0.07) 
      events per 100py in the group with, and without BEN, respectively. BEN is more 
      prevalent in Black South Africans compared to US Non-Hispanic Whites. Our data do 
      not support excluding populations from HIV vaccine trials because of BEN. BEN was 
      not associated with increased risk for HIV infection or Adverse events on a 
      vaccine trial. Predictors of HIV infection risk were females and cannabis use, 
      underlying the continued importance of prevention programmes in focusing on these 
      populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of financial incentives dependent on 
      continuous smoking abstinence on smoking cessation and birth outcomes among 
      pregnant smokers. DESIGN: Single blind, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 
      Financial Incentive for Smoking Cessation in Pregnancy (FISCP) trial in 18 
      maternity wards in France. PARTICIPANTS: 460 pregnant smokers aged at least 18 
      years who smoked ≤5 cigarettes/day or ≤3 roll-your-own cigarettes/day and had a 
      pregnancy gestation of <18 weeks were randomised to a financial incentives group 
      (n=231) or a control group (n=229). INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the financial 
      incentives group received a voucher equivalent to €20 (£17; $23), and further 
      progressively increasing vouchers at each study visit if they remained abstinent. 
      Participants in the control group received no financial incentive for abstinence. 
      All participants received a €20 show-up fee at each of six visits. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: The main outcome measure was continuous smoking abstinence from the 
      first post-quit date visit to visit 6, before delivery. Secondary outcomes in the 
      mothers were point prevalence abstinence, time to smoking relapse, withdrawal 
      symptoms, blood pressure, and alcohol and cannabis use in past 30 days. Secondary 
      outcomes in the babies were gestational age at birth, birth characteristics 
      (birth weight, length, head circumference, Apgar score), and a poor neonatal 
      outcome-a composite measure of transfer to the neonatal unit, congenital 
      malformation, convulsions, or perinatal death. RESULTS: Mean age was 29 years. In 
      the financial incentives and control groups, respectively, 137 (59%) and 148 
      (65%) were employed, 163 (71%) and 171 (75%) were in a relationship, and 41 (18%) 
      and 31 (13%) were married. The participants had smoked a median of 60 cigarettes 
      in the past seven days. The continuous abstinence rate was significantly higher 
      in the financial incentives group (16%, 38/231) than control group (7%, 17/229): 
      odds ratio 2.45 (95% confidence interval 1.34 to 4.49), P=0.004). The point 
      prevalence abstinence rate was higher (4.61, 1.41 to 15.01, P=0.011), the median 
      time to relapse was longer (visit 5 (interquartile range 3-6) and visit 4 (3-6), 
      P<0.001)), and craving for tobacco was lower (β=-1.81, 95% confidence interval 
      -3.55 to -0.08, P=0.04) in the financial incentives group than control group. 
      Financial incentives were associated with a 7% reduction in the risk of a poor 
      neonatal outcome: 4 babies (2%) in the financial incentives group and 18 babies 
      (9%) in the control group: mean difference 14 (95% confidence interval 5 to 23), 
      P=0.003. Post hoc analyses suggested that more babies in the financial incentives 
      group had birth weights ≥2500 g than in the control group: unadjusted odds ratio 
      1.95 (95% confidence interval 0.99 to 3.85), P=0.055; sex adjusted odds ratio 
      2.05 (1.03 to 4.10), P=0.041; and sex and prematurity adjusted odds ratio 2.06 
      (0.90 to 4.71), P=0.086. As these are post hoc analyses, the results should be 
      interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: Financial incentives to reward smoking 
      abstinence compared with no financial incentives were associated with an 
      increased abstinence rate in pregnant smokers. Financial incentives dependent on 
      smoking abstinence could be implemented as a safe and effective intervention to 
      help pregnant smokers quit smoking. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Associations between driving under the influence or riding with an impaired 
      driver and future substance use among adolescents.
PG  - 563-569
LID - 10.1080/15389588.2019.1615620 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Risky driving behaviors among adolescents, such as riding with a 
      drinking or impaired driver (RWID) or driving while under the influence (DUI) of 
      alcohol or drugs, are significant public health concerns. Few studies have 
      examined associations of RWID and DUI with future substance use and problems 
      after controlling for baseline substance use. Given that the DUI/RWDD event may 
      be a teachable moment to prevent future consequences (e.g., when injured or 
      arrested), it is important to understand how this risk behavior relates to 
      subsequent use and problems. This study therefore examined characteristics of 
      adolescents who reported DUI and RWID and assessed their risk of future alcohol 
      and marijuana use and consequences 6 months later. Methods: Participants were 668 
      adolescents aged 12 to 18 (inclusive) recruited at 1 of 4 primary care clinics in 
      Pittsburgh and Los Angeles as part of a larger randomized controlled trial. They 
      completed surveys about their health behaviors at baseline and 6 months after 
      baseline. We examined baseline characteristics of adolescents who reported DUI 
      and RWID and then assessed whether past-year DUI and RWID at baseline were 
      associated with alcohol and marijuana use and consequences 6 months after 
      baseline. Results: Fifty-eight percent of participants were female, 56% were 
      Hispanic, 23% were Black, 14% were White, 7% were multiethnic or other, and the 
      average age was 16 years (SD = 1.9). At baseline, participants who reported RWID 
      or DUI were more likely to be older, report past-year use of alcohol and 
      marijuana, and more likely to have an alcohol use disorder or cannabis use 
      disorder versus those who did not report RWID or DUI, respectively. At 6-month 
      follow-up and after controlling for baseline demographics and baseline alcohol 
      use, RWID was associated with more frequent drinking episodes in the past 3 
      months and greater number of drinks in the past month when they drank heavily. 
      DUI at baseline was associated with more frequent heavy drinking episodes and 
      alcohol and marijuana consequences 6 months later. Conclusions: RWID and DUI are 
      significantly associated with greater alcohol and marijuana use over time. This 
      study highlights that teens may be at higher risk for problem substance use in 
      the future even if they ride with someone who is impaired. Prevention and 
      intervention efforts for adolescents need to address both driving under the 
      influence and riding with an impaired driver to prevent downstream consequences.

TI  - Using Ecological Momentary Assessment to Identify Mechanisms of Change: An 
      Application From a Pharmacotherapy Trial With Adolescent Cannabis Users.
PG  - 190-198
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study used youth's in vivo reports of subjective responses 
      to cannabis while smoking in their natural environments to identify real-world 
      mechanisms of topiramate treatment for cannabis misuse. METHOD: Participants were 
      40 cannabis users (≥ twice weekly in past 30 days), ages 15-24 years (47.5% 
      female), with at least one cannabis use episode during the final 3 weeks of a 
      6-week, randomized clinical trial. Youth reported subjective "high" while 
      smoking, stimulation, sedation, stress, craving, and grams of marijuana used in 
      the natural environment via wireless electronic devices. Bayesian multilevel 
      structural equation modeling (MSEM) evaluated mediation via indirect effect 
      tests. RESULTS: Significant within (daily) and between (person) variability and 
      distinctive within and between effects supported the MSEM approach. Subjective 
      high while smoking was significantly reduced for youth in the topiramate 
      condition, relative to placebo, and the indirect effect of reduced subjective 
      high on total grams of cannabis smoked that day was significant. Indirect effects 
      through other subjective responses were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      of this initial study suggest that altering subjective responses to smoking, 
      specifically subjective high, may be a key target for developing adjunctive 
      pharmacotherapies for cannabis misuse. More generally, this work provides an 
      example for applying ecological momentary assessment and analytic techniques to 
      evaluate mechanisms of behavior change in longitudinal data.

TI  - Acute separate and combined effects of cannabinoid and nicotinic receptor 
      agonists on MMN-indexed auditory deviance detection in healthy humans.

AB  - The high prevalence of concomitant cannabis and nicotine use has implications for 
      sensory and cognitive processing. While nicotine tends to enhance function in 
      these domains, cannabis use has been associated with both sensory and cognitive 
      impairments, though the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Additionally, the 
      interaction of the nicotinic (nAChR) and cannabinoid (CB(1)) receptor systems has 
      received limited study in terms of sensory/cognitive processes. This study 
      involving healthy volunteers assessed the acute separate and combined effects of 
      nabilone (a CB(1) agonist) and nicotine on sensory processing as assessed by 
      auditory deviance detection and indexed by the mismatch negativity (MMN) 
      event-related potential. It was hypothesized that nabilone would impair auditory 
      discriminability as shown by diminished MMN amplitudes, but not when administered 
      in combination with nicotine. 20 male non-smokers and non-cannabis-users were 
      assessed using a 5-stimulus 'optimal' multi-feature MMN paradigm within a 
      randomized, placebo controlled design (placebo; nabilone [0.5 mg]; nicotine 
      [6 mg]; and nicotine + nabilone). Treatment effects were region- and 
      deviant-dependent. At the temporal regions (mastoid sites), MMN was reduced by 
      nabilone and nicotine separately, whereas co-administration resulted in no 
      impairment. At the frontal region, MMN was enhanced by co-administration of 
      nicotine and nabilone, with no MMN effects being found with separate treatment. 
      These neural effects have relevance for sensory/cognitive processes influenced by 
      separate and simultaneous use of cannabis and tobacco and may have treatment 
      implications for disorders associated with sensory dysfunction and impairments in 
      endocannabinoid and nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health warnings have been shown to increase knowledge and awareness 
      of health risks, influence social norms, and reduce consumption of tobacco 
      products. With the legalization of non-medical cannabis in Canada and other 
      subnational jurisdictions, there is a need for empirical studies to examine the 
      impact of cannabis health warnings on consumer perceptions and behaviour relevant 
      to cannabis. METHODS: In October 2017, a between-group experiment was conducted 
      as part of an online survey of Canadians aged 16 to 30 years (N = 870) recruited 
      from a national consumer panel. Participants rated the perceived effectiveness 
      and believability of either text-only or pictorial cannabis health warnings and 
      then completed a message recall task. Participants also reported their level of 
      support for cannabis warnings, and support for including cessation information 
      and a quitline on the warnings. RESULTS: Pictorial health warnings for cannabis 
      products were perceived as more effective and believable than text-only warnings 
      (p < 0.001), and the superiority of pictorial warnings was found across different 
      warnings: dose (p = 0.039), co-morbid drug use (p = 0.006), and pregnancy 
      (p < 0.001). Pictorial warnings were also rated as more believable (p = 0.048). 
      Overall, 87.7% respondents supported having health warnings on cannabis products, 
      and 84.0% supported the inclusion of a quitline number on cannabis health 
      warnings. CONCLUSION: The current study provides the first empirical test of 
      cannabis health warnings, consistent with the considerable body of evidence on 
      the effectiveness of pictorial warnings on tobacco products. There was strong 
      support for the inclusion of picture warnings and the inclusion of resources and 
      quitlines on cannabis packaging.

AB  - Be Under Your Own Influence (BUYOI) is a previously validated school-based 
      intervention designed to delay adolescent substance use (SU) initiation. This 
      study examined the effectiveness of a culturally-adapted version of BUYOI in 
      delaying SU initiation among reservation-dwelling American Indian (AI) youth. 
      Five reservation-based middle schools participated. Three schools were randomly 
      assigned to receive BUYOI-AI (N = 321), and two schools served as controls 
      (N = 176). Beginning in 7th grade, all participating students completed four 
      assessments over the study period. Discrete time hazard models estimated the 
      effects of BUYOI on students' risk of initiating alcohol, alcohol intoxication 
      and marijuana before the end of 8th grade. AI students exposed to BUYOI had a 
      lower risk of initiating alcohol use or intoxication, though sex moderated the 
      effect on intoxication. These findings provide preliminary support for the 
      effectiveness of a culturally-adapted version of BUYOI in delaying AI youth's 
      first-time alcohol use and intoxication.

TI  - Testing the role of the posterior cingulate cortex in processing salient stimuli 
      in cannabis users: an rTMS study.
PG  - 2357-2369
LID - 10.1111/ejn.14194 [doi]
AB  - The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus are hubs in the default mode 
      network and play a role in processing external salient stimuli. Accordingly, 
      activation in these regions has been associated with response to salient stimuli 
      using drug cue-reactivity paradigms in substance using populations. These studies 
      suggest that the PCC and precuneus may underlie deficits in processing salient 
      stimuli that contribute toward the development of substance use disorders. The 
      goal of this study was to directly test this hypothesis using repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Using a double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled design, we used rTMS to target the PCC and precuneus with a 
      double-cone coil at 10 Hz (high frequency) and 1 Hz (low frequency) in 10 adult 
      cannabis users and 10 age- and sex-matched non-using controls. 
      Electroencephalography data were collected before and after rTMS during a 
      modified oddball paradigm with neutral, oddball, self-relevant, and 
      cannabis-related stimuli. Cannabis users exhibited increased amplitude in P3 and 
      faster latencies in the P3, N2, and P2 components in response to self-relevant 
      stimuli compared to controls during baseline that normalized after rTMS. These 
      results suggest that cannabis users exhibited heightened salience to external 
      self-relevant stimuli that were modulated after rTMS. PCC dysfunction in cannabis 
      users may be related to abnormalities in processing salient stimuli, such those 
      during cue-reactivity, and provides a potential target for cannabis use disorder 
      intervention.

TI  - The efficacy of a working memory training in substance use patients: A randomized 
      double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 473-486
LID - 10.1080/13803395.2017.1372367 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Substance use disorder patients show impairments in working memory 
      (WM) functioning. Previous findings indicate that a WM training results in 
      improvements of working memory capacity (WMC) and in decreased clinical symptoms 
      in a range of mental disorders, including alcohol use disorder. METHOD: The aim 
      of the current study is to investigate the efficacy of a 24-session WM training 
      in addition to treatment as usual on craving, WMC, substance use, impulsivity, 
      attention bias, and psychopathology using a randomized double-blind 
      placebo-controlled trial. Inpatients (n = 180) diagnosed with an alcohol, 
      cocaine, or cannabis use disorder were included. RESULTS: Although the WM 
      training resulted in better scores on the trained tasks in both groups, the 
      placebo training resulted in a better or equal WMC compared to the experimental 
      training, as measured with two nontrained transfer tasks. The WM training had no 
      effect on craving, substance use, impulsivity, attention bias, and 
      psychopathology. CONCLUSION: Overall, we did not find evidence for the efficacy 
      of WM training on WMC or clinical symptoms as compared to a placebo training in a 
      population of substance use disorder patients. Future research needs to 
      investigate further whether WMC is an important factor that is associated with 
      substance-abuse-related behavior, and whether working memory training could be 
      useful in substance use disorders.

      cigarettes.
PG  - 359-364
LID - 10.1037/pha0000461 [doi]
AB  - Research on nicotine metabolism has primarily focused on white adults. This study 
      examined associations between nicotine metabolism, tobacco use, and demographic 
      characteristics among Alaska Native adults who smoke cigarettes. Participants (N 
      = 244) were Alaska Native adults who smoked and who provided a plasma sample at 
      baseline (70.1%) or follow-up (29.9%) of a randomized controlled trial of a 
      cardiovascular risk behavior intervention. At baseline, participants 
      self-reported age, sex, Alaska Native heritage, cigarettes per day, time to first 
      cigarette upon wakening, menthol use, perceived difficulty staying quit, tobacco 
      withdrawal symptoms, and past-month tobacco product use, binge drinking, and 
      cannabis use. At 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups, participants self-reported 
      7-day point prevalence abstinence from smoking. Height and weight were measured 
      to calculate body mass index (BMI). Participants' nicotine metabolite ratio 
      (NMR), calculated as the ratio of plasma cotinine and trans-3' hydroxycotinine, 
      was log-transformed. The sample (52.0% male, age M = 47.0 years [SD = 13.8], 
      60.3% of Inupiaq heritage) averaged 12.5 cigarettes per day (SD = 10.5); 64.0% 
      smoked within 30 min of wakening. NMR was not significantly associated with age, 
      sex, Alaska Native heritage, BMI, cigarettes per day, time to first cigarette 
      upon wakening, menthol use, perceived difficulty staying quit, past-month dual 
      tobacco product use, withdrawal symptoms, past-month binge drinking, past-month 
      cannabis use, or abstinence from smoking (all p-values > .050). Characteristics 
      that relate to NMR in Alaska Native adults may differ from those typically 
      identified among white adults. Specifically, results may suggest that Alaska 
      Native adults with slower nicotine metabolism do not titrate their nicotine 
      intake when smoking. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights

LID - 10.1111/dar.13405 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This cross-sectional study examined the associations of 
      demographic, structural and psychological factors with distinct typologies of 
      polysubstance use in sexual minority men (SMM) living with HIV who use 
      methamphetamine. METHODS: In total, 161 SMM living with HIV who reported 
      methamphetamine use in the past 3 months were recruited in San Francisco from 
      2013 to 2017 for a randomised controlled trial. A latent class analysis was 
      conducted by leveraging baseline measures of self-reported use of 15 substances 
      in the past 3 months as well as validated screening measures of hazardous alcohol 
      and cannabis use. Correlates of latent class membership were examined using a 
      three-step categorical latent variable logistic regression. RESULTS: Four 
      typologies of substance use were identified: (i) methamphetamine use only (43%); 
      (ii) methamphetamine and crack-cocaine use (22%); (iii) party and play 
      use-methamphetamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate and amyl nitrites (i.e. poppers) with 
      erectile dysfunction drugs (31%); and (iv) high polysubstance use (4%). SMM of 
      colour and those with a history of incarceration were more commonly classified as 
      engaging in methamphetamine and crack-cocaine use compared to party and play use. 
      Men with higher sexual compulsivity scores were more commonly classified as 
      engaging in party and play use and polysubstance use. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: 
      There is substantial heterogeneity in polysubstance use patterns among SMM living 
      with HIV who use methamphetamine. This will inform the development of tailored 
      substance use interventions addressing the unique needs of SMM of colour and 
      targeting sexual compulsivity as a prominent comorbidity for some men.

TI  - Mindfulness-based relapse prevention for cannabis regular users: Preliminary 
      outcomes of a randomized clinical trial.

AB  - Mindfulness-based approaches have shown their effectiveness in caring for 
      patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Mindfulness-based relapse prevention 
      (MBRP) integrates practices from mindfulness-based interventions and 
      cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention (RP) approaches. This article presents 
      the preliminary results of a study that measures the effectiveness of an MBRP 
      protocol for volunteer cannabis users willing to reduce or stop their 
      consumptions. Twenty cannabis users were randomly assigned to either receive an 
      eight-week outpatient MBRP program or treatment as usual (TAU). Cannabis use was 
      assessed weekly through the timeline follow back (TLFB). Eighty percent of 
      individuals received MBRP treatment and 60% of individuals received TAU completed 
      treatment. Preliminary results did not find significant difference at the end of 
      treatment (week 8) regarding the number of joints smoked. Despite the absence of 
      any significant difference between the two groups, the contribution of 
      mindfulness in the caring of SUD seems encouraging and promising. Many MBRP group 
      participants reported qualitative changes in the way they consumed. This study 
      will be continued in order to evaluate the effectiveness of MBRP on a larger 
      number of subjects.

TI  - Therapeutic Alliance, Client Need for Approval, and Perfectionism as Differential 
      Moderators of Response to eHealth and Traditionally Delivered Treatments for 
      Comorbid Depression and Substance Use Problems.
PG  - 728-739
LID - 10.1007/s12529-017-9676-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study sought to undertake an exploratory analysis of the impact of 
      therapeutic alliance and dysfunctional attitudes (perfectionism and need for 
      approval) on outcomes for participants receiving therapist-delivered and eHealth 
      interventions for comorbid depression and alcohol/cannabis use problems. These 
      factors have been shown in previous research to moderate response to 
      psychological treatment for depression and related disorders. METHOD: 
      Participants (N = 274) with concurrent depression and alcohol/cannabis misuse 
      were randomized to 10 sessions of therapist-delivered cognitive behavior 
      therapy/motivational interviewing (CBT/MI), computer-delivered CBT/MI with brief 
      therapist assistance (SHADE CBT/MI), or supportive counseling (PCT). Follow-up 
      occurred at 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline. Exploratory moderator analyses 
      examined changes in depression, alcohol use, and cannabis use over the 3-12-month 
      follow-up timepoints, adjusting for baseline, as a function of treatment 
      allocation, and the hypothesized moderators of therapeutic alliance, 
      perfectionism, and need for approval. RESULTS: The sample size and number of 
      comparisons in the analysis mean that the results are considered preliminary and 
      need replication in larger trials. The analysis revealed that "client 
      initiative," a subscale of therapeutic alliance, moderated change in depression 
      scores between 3- and 12-month follow-up for the PCT group, with higher scores 
      associated with decreases in depression over time. Higher therapeutic "bond" 
      early in treatment for SHADE CBT/MI participants was associated with reduced 
      cannabis use over time. Participants with higher "perfectionism" scores at 
      baseline who received therapist CBT/MI reported increases in depression over the 
      follow-up period, but reductions in depression if they received SHADE CBT/MI. 
      Therapist CBT/MI participants high on "need for approval" at baseline reported 
      better alcohol use outcomes over time. CONCLUSION: The preliminary nature of 
      these results do not justify firm conclusions. However, the specific variables of 
      perfectionism, need for approval, and client initiative show promise as 
      moderators of treatment efficacy for comorbid depression and alcohol/cannabis use 
      problems. Further research is justified to determine whether these factors can 
      assist in tailoring the modality and strategies offered in the delivery of 
      psychotherapy to this population.

TI  - A national effectiveness trial of an eHealth program to prevent alcohol and 
      cannabis misuse: responding to the replication crisis.
PG  - 274-282
LID - 10.1017/S0033291720001919 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The burden of disease attributable to alcohol and other drug (AOD) 
      use in young people is considerable. Prevention can be effective, yet few 
      programs have demonstrated replicable effects. This study aimed to replicate 
      research behind Climate Schools: Alcohol and Cannabis course among a large cohort 
      of adolescents. METHODS: Seventy-one secondary schools across three States 
      participated in a cluster-randomised controlled trial. Year 8 students received 
      either the web-based Climate Schools: Alcohol and Cannabis course (Climate, n = 
      3236), or health education as usual (Control, n = 3150). Outcomes were measured 
      via self-report and reported here for baseline, 6- and 12-months for alcohol and 
      cannabis knowledge, alcohol, cannabis use and alcohol-related harms. RESULTS: 
      Compared to Controls, students in the Climate group showed greater increases in 
      alcohol- [standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.51, p < 0.001] and 
      cannabis-related knowledge (SMD 0.49, p < 0.001), less increases in the odds of 
      drinking a full standard drink[(odds ratio (OR) 0.62, p = 0.014], and heavy 
      episodic drinking (OR 0.49, p = 0.022). There was no evidence for differences in 
      change over time in the odds of cannabis use (OR 0.57, p = 0.22) or alcohol harms 
      (OR 0.73, p = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides support for the 
      effectiveness of the web-based Climate Schools: Alcohol and Cannabis course in 
      increasing knowledge and reducing the uptake of alcohol. It represents one of the 
      first trials of a web-based AOD prevention program to replicate alcohol effects 
      in a large and diverse sample of students. Future research and/or adaptation of 
      the program may be warranted with respect to prevention of cannabis use and 
      alcohol harms.

TI  - Methylphenidate's effects on thalamic metabolism and functional connectivity in 
      cannabis abusers and healthy controls.
PG  - 1389-1397
LID - 10.1038/s41386-018-0287-2 [doi]
AB  - Methylphenidate (MPH) is a first line treatment for ADHD and is also misused as a 
      purported cognitive enhancer, yet its effects on brain function are still poorly 
      understood. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies showed 
      that MPH altered cortico-striatal resting functional connectivity (RFC). Here we 
      investigated the effects of MPH in thalamic connectivity since the thalamus 
      modulates striato-cortical signaling. We hypothesized that MPH would increase 
      thalamic connectivity and metabolism, and that this response would be blunted in 
      cannabis abusers. For this purpose, we measured RFC in seven thalamic nuclei 
      using fMRI and brain glucose metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) 
      and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in sixteen healthy controls and thirteen 
      participants with cannabis use disorder (CUD) twice after placebo and after MPH 
      (0.5 mg/kg, iv). MPH significantly increased thalamo-cerebellar connectivity and 
      cerebellar metabolism to the same extent in both groups. Group comparisons 
      revealed that in CUD compared to controls, metabolism in nucleus accumbens was 
      lower for the placebo and MPH measures, that MPH-induced increases in thalamic 
      metabolism were blunted, and that enhanced negative connectivity between thalamus 
      and accumbens in CUD was normalized by MPH (reducing negative connectivity). Our 
      findings identify the thalamus as a target of MPH, which increased its metabolism 
      and connectivity. The reduced metabolism in nucleus accumbens and the disrupted 
      thalamo-accumbens connectivity (enhanced negative connectivity) in CUD is 
      consistent with impaired reactivity of the brain reward's circuit. MPH's 
      normalization of thalamo-accumbens connectivity (reduced negative connectivity) 
      brings forth its potential therapeutic value in CUD, which merits investigation.

AB  - Cannabis use has been associated with altered sensory gating and neural 
      oscillations. However, it is unclear which constituent in cannabis is responsible 
      for these effects, or whether these are cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) mediated. 
      Therefore, the present study in humans and rats examined whether cannabinoid 
      administration would disrupt sensory gating and evoked oscillations utilizing 
      electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFPs), respectively. 
      Human subjects (n = 15) completed four test days during which they received 
      intravenous delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC), cannabidiol (CBD), 
      Δ(9)-THC + CBD, or placebo. Subjects engaged in a dual-click paradigm, and 
      outcome measures included P50 gating ratio (S2/S1) and evoked power to S1 and S2. 
      In order to examine CB1R specificity, rats (n = 6) were administered the CB1R 
      agonist CP-55940, CP-55940+AM-251 (a CB1R antagonist), or vehicle using the same 
      paradigm. LFPs were recorded from CA3 and entorhinal cortex. Both Δ(9)-THC 
      (p < 0.007) and Δ(9)-THC + CBD (p < 0.004) disrupted P50 gating ratio compared to 
      placebo, while CBD alone had no effect. Δ(9)-THC (p < 0.048) and Δ(9)-THC + CBD 
      (p < 0.035) decreased S1 evoked theta power, and in the Δ(9)-THC condition, S1 
      theta negatively correlated with gating ratios (r = -0.629, p < 0.012 (p < 0.048 
      adjusted)). In rats, CP-55940 disrupted gating in both brain regions 
      (p < 0.0001), and this was reversed by AM-251. Further, CP-55940 decreased evoked 
      theta (p < 0.0077) and gamma (p < 0.011) power to S1, which was partially blocked 
      by AM-251. These convergent human/animal data suggest that CB1R agonists disrupt 
      sensory gating by altering neural oscillations in the theta-band. Moreover, this 
      suggests that the endocannabinoid system mediates theta oscillations relevant to 
      perception and cognition.

TI  - Acute effects of Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol on auditory mismatch 
      negativity.
PG  - 1409-1424
LID - 10.1007/s00213-021-05997-3 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a candidate endophenotype for 
      schizophrenia subserved by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function and 
      there is increasing evidence that prolonged cannabis use adversely affects MMN 
      generation. Few human studies have investigated the acute effects of cannabinoids 
      on brain-based biomarkers of NMDAR function and synaptic plasticity. OBJECTIVES: 
      The current study investigated the acute effects of Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol 
      (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) alone and in combination on the mismatch negativity 
      (MMN). METHODS: In a randomised, double-blind, crossover placebo-controlled 
      study, 18 frequent and 18 less-frequent cannabis users underwent 5 randomised 
      drug sessions administered via vaporiser: (1) placebo; (2) THC 8 mg; (3) CBD 
      400 mg; (4) THC 8 mg + CBD 4 mg [THC + CBD(low)]; (5) THC 12 mg + CBD 400 mg [THC 
      + CBD(high)]. Participants completed a multifeature MMN auditory oddball paradigm 
      with duration, frequency and intensity deviants (6% each). RESULTS: Relative to 
      placebo, both THC and CBD were observed to increase duration and intensity MMN 
      amplitude in less-frequent users, and THC also increased frequency MMN in this 
      group. The addition of low-dose CBD added to THC attenuated the effect of THC on 
      duration and intensity MMN amplitude in less-frequent users. The same pattern of 
      effects was observed following high-dose CBD added to THC on duration and 
      frequency MMN in frequent users. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of effects following 
      CBD combined with THC on MMN may be subserved by different underlying 
      neurobiological interactions within the endocannabinoid system that vary as a 
      function of prior cannabis exposure. These results highlight the complex 
      interplay between the acute effects of exogenous cannabinoids and NMDAR function. 
      Further research is needed to determine how this process normalises after the 
      acute effects dissipate and following repeated acute exposure.

TI  - Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms and Emerging Adult Sexual Minority Men: 
      Implications for Assessment and Treatment of Childhood Sexual Abuse.
PG  - 665-675
LID - 10.1002/jts.22335 [doi]
AB  - Emerging adulthood (EA) is a developmental period marked by unique challenges 
      that affect health including burgeoning occupational, relational, and financial 
      stability; and increased risk taking in terms of sexual behavior(s) and substance 
      use. Data were collected from 296 HIV-uninfected sexual minority men with 
      childhood sexual abuse (CSA) histories. We analyzed baseline assessment data from 
      a multisite randomized controlled trial that tested the efficaciousness of an 
      experimental psychosocial treatment and examined vulnerabilities known to be 
      linked with CSA. Our analyses compared EA sexual minority men, aged 18-29, with 
      older sexual minority men (OSMM) on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 
      other mental health and substance use outcomes. We found higher odds of PTSD, 
      odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% CI [0.33, 0.96]; panic disorder or panic disorder 
      with agoraphobia, OR = 0.36, 95% CI [0.16, 0.85]; and cocaine use, OR = 0.50, 95% 
      CI [0.25, 0.97], among OSMM and higher odds of alcohol intoxication, OR = 5.60, 
      95% CI [3.20, 9.82]; cannabis use, OR = 3.09, 95% CI [1.83, 5.21]; and non-HIV 
      sexually transmitted infections, OR = 3.03, 95% CI [1.29, 7.13], among the EA 
      men. These results present a complex picture of health risks among sexual 
      minority men in general and EA sexual minority men in particular. HIV 
      seroconversion linked health risk behaviors, among sexual minority men, may be 
      better addressed via increased attention to treating trauma and comorbid mental 
      health and substance use problems using evidence-based psychosocial assessments 
      and integrated treatment platforms that are tailored to this population.

TI  - Textual and pictorial enhancement of cannabis warning labels: An Online 
      experiment among at-risk U.S. young adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study experimentally examines whether enhanced cannabis warning 
      labels (CWLs) outperform those currently required in the U.S. in improving recall 
      of health risks, emotional responses, and perceived message effectiveness among 
      at-risk young adults. METHOD: We conducted an online national survey-based 
      experiment in October 2020. Young adults aged 18-26 years old and at-risk for 
      cannabis use (N = 523) were randomly assigned in an online experiment, to view 
      either currently required CWLs in California with small font and a composite 
      health risk statement, or enhanced single-theme CWLs with varying textual and 
      pictorial components. We performed linear regression analyses to compare the 
      enhanced with existing CWLs on information recall, negative emotions, and 
      perceived message effectiveness. Furthermore, information recall and negative 
      emotions were examined as parallel mediators to better understand the mechanisms 
      underlying effective textual and pictorial enhancement of CWLs. RESULTS: Compared 
      with currently required CWLs in California, both textually (b = 0.30, p = .011) 
      and pictorially (b = 0.59, p < .001) enhanced CWLs increased recall accuracy. 
      Pictorially enhanced CWLs outperformed their text-only counterparts (b = 0.28, 
      p = .019) in improving information recall. Only pictorially enhanced CWLs 
      improved perceived message effectiveness (b = 0.31, p = .008), which was mediated 
      by negative emotions but not by information recall. CONCLUSIONS: Given rapid 
      expansion of the cannabis industry and declining perception of harm, currently 
      required CWLs in the U.S. such as California's, would benefit from redesign to 
      improve public understanding of health risks and to prevent youth use.

TI  - The effects of MDMA-assisted therapy on alcohol and substance use in a phase 3 
      trial for treatment of severe PTSD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly associated with 
      alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD). A randomized, placebo-controlled, 
      phase 3 trial demonstrated the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted therapy 
      (MDMA-AT) for the treatment of severe PTSD. This analysis explores patterns of 
      alcohol and substance use in patients receiving MDMA-AT compared to placebo plus 
      therapy (Placebo+Therapy). METHODS: Adult participants with severe PTSD (n = 90) 
      were randomized to three blinded trauma-focused therapy sessions with either 
      MDMA-AT or Placebo+Therapy. Eligible participants met DSM-5 criteria for severe 
      PTSD and could meet criteria for mild (current) or moderate (early remission) 
      alcohol or cannabis use disorder; other SUDs were excluded. The current analyses 
      examined outcomes on standardized measures of hazardous alcohol (i.e., Alcohol 
      Use Disorder Identification Test; AUDIT) and drug (i.e., Drug Use Disorder 
      Identification Test; DUDIT) use at baseline prior to randomization and at study 
      termination. RESULTS: There were no treatment group differences in AUDIT or DUDIT 
      scores at baseline. Compared to Placebo+therapy, MDMA-AT was associated with a 
      significantly greater reduction in mean (SD) AUDIT change scores (Δ = -1.02 
      (3.52) as compared to placebo (Δ = 0.40 (2.70), F (80, 1) = 4.20, p = 0.0436; 
      Hedge's g= .45). Changes in DUDIT scores were not significantly different between 
      treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA-AT for severe PTSD may also lead to 
      subclinical improvements in alcohol use. MDMA-AT does not appear to increase risk 
      of illicit drug use. These data provide preliminary evidence to support the 
      development of MDMA-AT as an integrated treatment for co-occurring PTSD and ASUD.

TI  - Detection of Δ(9) THC in oral fluid following vaporized cannabis with varied 
      cannabidiol (CBD) content: An evaluation of two point-of-collection testing 
      devices.
PG  - 1486-1497
LID - 10.1002/dta.2687 [doi]
AB  - Point-of-collection testing (POCT) for Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in oral 
      fluid is increasingly used to detect driving under the influence of cannabis 
      (DUIC). However, previous studies have questioned the reliability and accuracy of 
      two commonly used POCT devices, the Securetec DrugWipe(®) 5 s (DW5s) and Dräger 
      DrugTest(®) 5000 (DT5000). In the current placebo controlled, double-blind, 
      crossover study we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
      to accurately quantify cannabinoid concentrations in the oral fluid of 14 
      participants at various timepoints (10, 60, 120, and 180 minutes) following 
      vaporization of 125 mg of THC-dominant (11% THC; <1% CBD), THC/CBD equivalent 
      (11% THC; 11% CBD) and placebo (<1% THC; <1% CBD) cannabis. At each timepoint, 
      oral fluid was also screened using the DW5s (10 ng/mL THC cut-off) and DT5000 
      (10 ng/mL THC cut-off). LC-MS/MS analysis showed peak oral fluid THC 
      concentrations at the 10 minute timepoint with a rapid decline thereafter. This 
      trajectory did not differ with THC dominant and THC/CBD equivalent cannabis. With 
      a 10 ng/mL confirmatory cut-off, 5% of DW5s test results were false positives and 
      16% false negatives. For the DT5000, 10% of test results were false positives and 
      9% false negatives. Neither the DW5s nor the DT5000 demonstrated the recommended 
      >80% sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Accuracy was lowest at 60 minutes, 
      when THC concentrations were often close to the screening cut-off (10 ng/mL). 
      POCT devices can be useful tools in detecting recent cannabis use; however, 
      limitations should be noted, and confirmatory LC-MS/MS quantification of results 
      is strongly advisable.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the longitudinal treatment effect on 
      depression measured by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score in a 
      randomized clinical trial for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). 
      METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis of data from the National 
      Institute on Drug Abuse's Clinical Trials Network Protocol-0051. Patients with 
      OUD (N = 570) were randomized to receive buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP-NX, n = 287) 
      or extended-release naltrexone injection (XR-NTX, n = 283). The HAM-D score was 
      completed at baseline and follow-up visit up to 36 weeks. A linear mixed model 
      analysis was performed for log transformed HAM-D score and a generalized linear 
      mixed model analysis was conducted for depression status. RESULTS: Compared with 
      BUP-NX, subjects randomized to XR-NTX had higher HAM-D scores at weeks 1 and 3 
      (p<0.05). There were significant interactions between treatment and visit on 
      HAM-D score and depression status during the first four weeks of treatments in 
      individuals without lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD). Past year cocaine 
      use was associated with HAM-D score and depression status just in individuals 
      without MDD, whereas past year cannabis use was associated with HAM-D score and 
      depression status just in individuals with MDD. Past year amphetamine use was 
      associated with HAM-D score just in individuals without MDD, however, lifetime 
      anxiety was associated with HAM-D scores regardless of MDD. CONCLUSION: When 
      prescribing XR-NTX, particularly in the first month of treatment, it is essential 
      to monitor for depressive symptoms. Screening for depression and multiple 
      substance abuse may help clinicians identify appropriate treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE: The initiation and escalation of substance use and sex behaviors is 
      prevalent during adolescence. School-based health centers (SBHCs) are 
      well-equipped to provide interventions for risky behaviors and offer sexually 
      transmitted infection (STI) testing services. This study examined receipt of STI 
      testing following brief intervention (BI) among sexually active adolescents. 
      METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial comparing 
      computer versus nurse practitioner-delivered BI approaches among adolescents 
      (ages 14-18) with risky alcohol and/or cannabis use at two SBHCs within two urban 
      high schools. Associations were examined among receipt of STI testing and 
      participant characteristics, BI format, site, and frequency of substance 
      use/sexual behaviors. RESULTS: Among sexually active participants (N = 254), 
      64.2% received STI testing at their SBHC within 6 months of receiving a BI. 
      Participants receiving nurse practitioner-delivered BI had higher odds of getting 
      STI testing than participants receiving computer-delivered BI (adjusted odds 
      ratio 2.51, 95% confidence interval 1.41-4.47, p = .002). Other variables 
      associated with STI testing in multivariable logistic regression included female 
      sex (p = .001), being in a serious relationship (p = .018), and SBHC site (p < 
      .001). Frequency of substance use and sexual risk behaviors were not 
      independently associated with receipt of STI testing services. CONCLUSION: 
      Sexually active adolescents who received in-person BI from a nurse practitioner 
      were more likely to get STI testing than adolescents who received BI via 
      computer. Nurse practitioners working in SBHCs can successfully engage 
      adolescents in additional sexual health services subsequent to BI for risky 
      behaviors.

TI  - Critical Time Intervention for Homeless People Making the Transition to Community 
      Living: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 175-186
LID - 10.1002/ajcp.12150 [doi]
AB  - To help create an evidence base in Europe for effective interventions that 
      improve the well-being of homeless people, we tested whether critical time 
      intervention (CTI), a time-limited intervention developed to support vulnerable 
      people during times of transition, is effective outside the United States. For 
      this multicenter, parallel-group randomized controlled trial, 183 adults who were 
      moving from shelters in the Netherlands to supported or independent housing were 
      allocated to CTI or care-as-usual. The primary outcome was number of days 
      rehoused, which was assessed by interviewing participants four times during a 
      9-month follow-up. Outcomes were analyzed with three-level mixed-effects models. 
      The primary outcome did not differ between groups. CTI had a significant effect 
      on family support and, for people experiencing less social support, psychological 
      distress. Groups did not differ significantly on social support, fulfillment of 
      care needs, quality of life, self-esteem, excessive alcohol use, or cannabis use. 
      Because few participants were homeless at 9 months, more research is needed to 
      establish whether CTI can prevent long-term recurrent homelessness. Given recent 
      emphasis on informal support in public services and positive effects of CTI on 
      family support and psychological distress, CTI is a fitting intervention for 
      Dutch shelter services.

TI  - Pathways to prevention: protocol for the CAP (Climate and Preventure) study to 
      evaluate the long-term effectiveness of school-based universal, selective and 
      combined alcohol misuse prevention into early adulthood.
PG  - 643
LID - 10.1186/s12889-018-5554-y [doi]
LID - 643
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol use and associated harms are among the leading causes of 
      burden of disease among young people, highlighting the need for effective 
      prevention. The Climate and Preventure (CAP) study was the first trial of a 
      combined universal and selective school-based approach to preventing alcohol 
      misuse among adolescents. Initial results indicate that universal, selective and 
      combined prevention were all effective in delaying the uptake of alcohol use and 
      binge drinking for up to 3 years following the interventions. However, little is 
      known about the sustainability of prevention effects across the transition to 
      early adulthood, a period of increased exposure to alcohol and other drug use. 
      This paper describes the protocol for the CAP long-term follow-up study which 
      will determine the effectiveness of universal, selective and combined alcohol 
      misuse prevention up to 7 years post intervention, and across the transition from 
      adolescence into early adulthood. METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial 
      was conducted between 2012 and 2015 with 2190 students (mean age: 13.3 yrs) from 
      26 Australian high schools. Participants were randomized to receive one of four 
      conditions; universal prevention for all students (Climate); selective prevention 
      for high-risk students (Preventure); combined universal and selective prevention 
      (Climate and Preventure; CAP); or health education as usual (Control). The 
      positive effect of the interventions on alcohol use at 12-, 24- and 36-month post 
      baseline have previously been reported. This study will follow up the CAP study 
      cohort approximately 5- and 7-years post baseline. The primary outcome will be 
      alcohol use and related harms. Secondary outcomes will be cannabis use, alcohol 
      and other drug harms including violent behavior, and mental health 
      symptomatology. Analyses will be conducted using multi-level, mixed effects 
      models within an intention-to-treat framework. DISCUSSION: This study will 
      provide the first ever evaluation of the long-term effectiveness of combining 
      universal and selective approaches to alcohol prevention and will examine the 
      durability of intervention effects into the longer-term, over a 7-year period 
      from adolescence to early adulthood. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was 
      registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( 
      ACTRN12612000026820 ) on January 6th 2012.

TI  - Effect of Medical Marijuana Card Ownership on Pain, Insomnia, and Affective 
      Disorder Symptoms in Adults: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e222106
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.2106 [doi]
LID - e222106
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Despite the legalization and widespread use of cannabis products for 
      a variety of medical concerns in the US, there is not yet a strong clinical 
      literature to support such use. The risks and benefits of obtaining a medical 
      marijuana card for common clinical outcomes are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the effect of obtaining a medical marijuana card on target clinical and 
      cannabis use disorder (CUD) symptoms in adults with a chief concern of chronic 
      pain, insomnia, or anxiety or depressive symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This pragmatic, single-site, single-blind randomized clinical trial 
      was conducted in the Greater Boston area from July 1, 2017, to July 31, 2020. 
      Participants were adults aged 18 to 65 years with a chief concern of pain, 
      insomnia, or anxiety or depressive symptoms. Participants were randomized 2:1 to 
      either the immediate card acquisition group (n = 105) or the delayed card 
      acquisition group (n = 81). Randomization was stratified by chief concern, age, 
      and sex. The statistical analysis followed an evaluable population approach. 
      INTERVENTIONS: The immediate card acquisition group was allowed to obtain a 
      medical marijuana card immediately after randomization. The delayed card 
      acquisition group was asked to wait 12 weeks before obtaining a medical marijuana 
      card. All participants could choose cannabis products from a dispensary, the 
      dose, and the frequency of use. Participants could continue their usual medical 
      or psychiatric care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were changes in 
      CUD symptoms, anxiety and depressive symptoms, pain severity, and insomnia 
      symptoms during the trial. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the 
      odds ratio (OR) for CUD diagnosis, and linear models were used for continuous 
      outcomes to estimate the mean difference (MD) in symptom scores. RESULTS: A total 
      of 186 participants (mean [SD] age 37.2 [14.4] years; 122 women [65.6%]) were 
      randomized and included in the analyses. Compared with the delayed card 
      acquisition group, the immediate card acquisition group had more CUD symptoms 
      (MD, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.15-0.40; P < .001); fewer self-rated insomnia symptoms (MD, 
      -2.90; 95% CI, -4.31 to -1.51; P < .001); and reported no significant changes in 
      pain severity or anxiety or depressive symptoms. Participants in the immediate 
      card acquisition group also had a higher incidence of CUD during the intervention 
      (17.1% [n = 18] in the immediate card acquisition group vs 8.6% [n = 7] in the 
      delayed card acquisition group; adjusted odds ratio, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.17-7.07; 
      P = .02), particularly those with a chief concern of anxiety or depressive 
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that 
      immediate acquisition of a medical marijuana card led to a higher incidence and 
      severity of CUD; resulted in no significant improvement in pain, anxiety, or 
      depressive symptoms; and improved self-rating of insomnia symptoms. Further 
      investigation of the benefits of medical marijuana card ownership for insomnia 
      and the risk of CUD are needed, particularly for individuals with anxiety or 
      depressive symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Profile of ∆9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, Cannabidiol and Metabolites 
      in Blood following Vaporization and Oral Ingestion of Cannabidiol Products.
PG  - 583-591
LID - 10.1093/jat/bkab124 [doi]
AB  - There is limited data on the comparative pharmacokinetics of cannabidiol (CBD) 
      across oral and vaporized formulations. This within-subject, double-blind, 
      double-dummy, placebo-controlled laboratory study analyzed the pharmacokinetic 
      profile of CBD, ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (∆9-THC) and related metabolites in blood 
      and oral fluid (OF) after participants (n = 18) administered 100 mg of CBD in 
      each of the following formulations: (1) oral CBD, (2) vaporized CBD and (3) 
      vaporized CBD-dominant cannabis containing 10.5% CBD and 0.39% ∆9-THC (3.7 mg); 
      all participants also completed a placebo condition. Oral CBD was administered in 
      three formulations: (1) encapsulated CBD, (2) CBD suspended in pharmacy-grade 
      syrup and (3) Epidiolex, allowing for pharmacokinetic comparisons across oral 
      formulations (n = 6 per condition). An optional fifth experimental condition was 
      completed for six participants in which they fasted from all food for 12 h prior 
      to oral ingestion of 100 mg of CBD. Blood and OF samples were collected 
      immediately before and for 57-58 h after each drug administration. Immunoassay 
      screening and LC-MS-MS confirmatory tests were performed, the limit of 
      quantitation was 0.5 ng/mL for ∆9-THC and 1 ng/mL for CBD. The mean Cmax and 
      range of CBD blood concentrations for each product were as follows: vaporized 
      CBD-dominant cannabis, 171.1 ng/mL, 40.0-665.0 ng/mL, vaporized CBD 104.6 ng/mL, 
      19.0-312.0 ng/mL and oral CBD, 13.7 ng/mL, 0.0-50.0 ng/mL. Of the three oral 
      formulations, Epidiolex produced the greatest peak concentration of CBD 
      (20.5 ng/mL, 8.0-37.0 ng/mL) relative to the capsule (17.8 ng/mL, 2.0-50.0 ng/mL) 
      and syrup (2.8 ng/mL, 0-7.0 ng/mL). ∆9-THC was detected in the blood of 12/18 
      participants after vaporized CBD-dominant cannabis use, but neither ∆9-THC nor 
      its metabolite THC-COOH were detected in the blood of any participants after 
      vaporized or oral CBD-only administration. These data demonstrate that different 
      oral and vaporized formulations produce substantial variability in the 
      pharmacokinetics of CBD and that CBD alone is unlikely to convert to ∆9-THC or 
      produce positive drug tests for ∆9-THC or its metabolite.

TI  - Effectiveness of the Strengthening Families Programme in the UK at preventing 
      substance misuse in 10-14 year-olds: a pragmatic randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e049647
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049647 [doi]
LID - e049647
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Strengthening Families Programme 10-14 (SFP10-14) is a 
      USA-developed universal group-based intervention aiming to prevent substance 
      misuse by strengthening protective factors within the family. This study 
      evaluated a proportionate universal implementation of the adapted UK version 
      (SFP10-14UK) which brought together families identified as likely/not likely to 
      experience/present challenges within a group setting. DESIGN: Pragmatic 
      cluster-randomised controlled effectiveness trial, with families as the unit of 
      randomisation and embedded process and economic evaluations. SETTING: The study 
      took place in seven counties of Wales, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 715 families (919 
      parents/carers, 931 young people) were randomised. INTERVENTIONS: Families 
      randomised to the intervention arm received the SFP10-14 comprising seven weekly 
      sessions. Families in intervention and control arms received existing services as 
      normal. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the number of occasions young 
      people reported drinking alcohol in the last 30 days; and drunkenness during the 
      same period, dichotomised as 'never' and '1-2 times or more'. Secondary outcomes 
      examined alcohol/tobacco/substance behaviours including: cannabis use; weekly 
      smoking (validated by salivary cotinine measures); age of alcohol initiation; 
      frequency of drinking >5 drinks in a row; frequency of different types of 
      alcoholic drinks; alcohol-related problems. Retention: primary analysis included 
      746 young people (80.1%) (alcohol consumption) and 732 young people (78.6%) 
      (drunkenness). RESULTS: There was no evidence of statistically significant 
      between-group differences 2 years after randomisation for primary outcomes (young 
      people's alcohol consumption in the last 30 days adjusted OR=1.11, 95% CI 0.72 to 
      1.71, p=0.646; drunkenness in the last 30 days adjusted OR=1.46, 95% CI 0.83 to 
      2.55, p=0.185). There were no statistically significant between-group differences 
      for other substance use outcomes, or those relating to well-being/stress, and 
      emotional/behavioural problems. CONCLUSIONS: Previous evidence of effectiveness 
      was not replicated. Findings highlight the importance of evaluating interventions 
      when they are adapted for new settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:
